          <al>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs presents its compliments to the
            Royal Netherlands Embassy and with reference to the note of 21
            December 1998, has the honour to communicate the following.</al>
          <al>In a communication dated 24 September 1998 <redactie type="extra">Niet afgedrukt.</redactie> the Kingdom of Sweden accepted the proposal of the Royal
            Netherlands Embassy, contained in its note of 31 August 1998, which
            reads as follows.</al>
          <al>&#x201C;Your Excellency,</al>
          <al>I have the honour to propose, with reference to article 41,
            paragraph 2 of the Convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on
            European Union on the establishment of a European Police Office
            (Europol Convention, 26 July 1995), that the privileges and
            immunities necessary for the proper performance of the tasks of the
            liaison officers at Europol be agreed upon as set out in the Attachment.</al>
          <al>If this proposal is acceptable to the Government of the Kingdom of
            Sweden, I propose that this note and Your Excellency's
            affirmative reply shall constitute an Agreement between the Kingdom
            of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Sweden, which shall enter into
            force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt by
            me of Your Excellency's reply.</al>
          <al>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Your
            Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.&#x201D;</al>
          <al>The entering into force of the agreement in question, attached to
            the above-mentioned note, is in the opinion of the Kingdom of Sweden
            dependent upon the achievement of understanding on identical
            agreements, regarding privileges and immunities to be enjoyed by the
            liaison officers, between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
            Parties to the Convention based on Article K.3 of the Treaty on
            European Union on the establishment of a European Police Office
            (Europol Convention, 26 July 1995). Cf. Article 41, paragraph 2, of
            the Convention. </al>
          <al>Consequently, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to
            communicate that it is the opinion of the Kingdom of Sweden that the
            agreement came into force 1 January 1999 being, according to
            information received from the Royal Netherlands Embassy, the first
            day of the month following the achievement of understanding upon
            identical agreements between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
            Parties to the Europol Convention.</al>
          <al>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs avails itself of this opportunity
            to renew to the Royal Netherlands Embassy the assurances of its
            highest consideration.</al>
