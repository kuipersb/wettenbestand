    <tussenkop>YORK-ANTWERP RULES 1994 </tussenkop>
    <tussenkop>RULE OF INTERPRETATION</tussenkop>
    <al>In the adjustment of general average the following Rules shall
        apply to the exclusion of any Law and Practice inconsistent therewith.</al>
    <al>Except as provided by the Rule Paramount and the numbered Rules,
        general average shall be adjusted according to the lettered
        Rules. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE PARAMOUNT</tussenkop>
    <al>In no case shall there be any allowance for sacrifice or
        expenditure unless reasonably made or incurred. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE A</tussenkop>
    <al>There is a general average act when, and only when, any
        extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure is intentionally and
        reasonably made or incurred for the common safety for the
        purpose of preserving from peril the property involved in a
        common maritime adventure.</al>
    <al>General average sacrifices and expenditures shall be borne by
        the different contributing interests on the basis hereinafter
        provided. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE B</tussenkop>
    <al>There is a common maritime adventure when one or more vessels
        are towing or pushing another vessel or vessels, provided that
        they are all involved in commercial activities and not in a
        salvage operation.</al>
    <al>When measures are taken to preserve the vessels and their
        cargoes, if any, from a common peril, these Rules shall apply.</al>
    <al>A vessel is not in common peril with another vessel or vessels
        if by simply disconnecting from the other vessel or vessels she
        is in safety; but if the disconnection is itself a general
        average act the common maritime adventure continues. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE C</tussenkop>
    <al>Only such losses, damages or expenses which are the direct
        consequence of the general average act shall be allowed as
        general average.</al>
    <al>In no case shall there be any allowance in general average for
        losses, damages or expenses incurred in respect of damage to the
        environment or in consequence of the escape or release of
        pollutant substances from the property involved in the common
        maritime adventure.</al>
    <al>Demurrage, loss of market, and any loss or damage sustained or
        expense incurred by reason of delay, whether on the voyage or
        subsequently, and any indirect loss whatsoever, shall not be
        admitted as general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE D</tussenkop>
    <al>Rights to contribution in general average shall not be affected,
        though the event which gave rise to the sacrifice or expenditure
        may have been due to the fault of one of the parties to the
        adventure; but this shall not prejudice any remedies or defences
        which may be open against or to that party in respect of such
        fault. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE E</tussenkop>
    <al>The onus of proof is upon the party claiming in general average
        to show that the loss or expense claimed is properly allowable
        as general average. </al>
    <al>All parties claiming in general average shall give notice in
        writing to the average adjuster of the loss or expense in
        respect of which they claim contribution within 12 months of the
        date of the termination of the common maritime adventure.</al>
    <al>Failing such notification, or if within 12 months of a request
        for the same any of the parties shall fail to supply evidence in
        support of a notified claim, or particulars of value in respect
        of a contributory interest, the average adjuster shall be at
        liberty to estimate the extent of the allowance or the
        contributory value on the basis of the information available to
        him, which estimate may be challenged only on the ground that it
        is manifestly incorrect. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE F</tussenkop>
    <al>Any additional expense incurred in place of another expense
        which would have been allowable as general average shall be
        deemed to be general average and so allowed without regard to
        the saving, if any, to other interests, but only up to the
        amount of the general average expense avoided. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE G</tussenkop>
    <al>General average shall be adjusted as regards both loss and
        contribution upon the basis of values at the time and place when
        and where the adventure ends.</al>
    <al>This rule shall not affect the determination of the place at
        which the average statement is to be made up.</al>
    <al>When a ship is at any port or place in circumstances which would
        give rise to an allowance in general average under the
        provisions of Rules X and XI, and the cargo or part thereof is
        forwarded to destination by other means, rights and liabilities
        in general average shall, subject to cargo interests being
        notified if practicable, remain as nearly as possible the same
        as they would have been in the absence of such forwarding, as if
        the adventure had continued in the original ship for so long as
        justifiable under the contract of affreightment and the
        applicable law.</al>
    <al>The proportion attaching to cargo of the allowances made in
        general average by reason of applying the third paragraph of
        this Rule shall not exceed the cost which would have been borne
        by the owners of cargo if the cargo had been forwarded at their
        expense. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE I. JETTISON OF CARGO</tussenkop>
    <al>No jettison of cargo shall be made good as general average,
        unless such cargo is carried in accordance with the recognised
        custom of the trade. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE II. LOSS OR DAMAGE BY SACRIFICES FOR THE COMMON SAFETY</tussenkop>
    <al>Loss of or damage to the property involved in the common
        maritime adventure by or in consequence of a sacrifice made for
        the common safety, and by water which goes down a ship's
        hatches opened or other opening made for the purpose of making a
        jettison for the common safety, shall be made good as general
        average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE III. EXTINGUISHING FIRE ON SHIPBOARD</tussenkop>
    <al>Damage done to a ship and cargo, or either of them, by water or
        otherwise, including damage by beaching or scuttling a burning
        ship, in extinguishing a fire on board the ship, shall be made
        good as general average; except that no compensation shall be
        made for damage by smoke however caused or by heat of the fire. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE IV. CUTTING AWAY WRECK</tussenkop>
    <al>Loss or damage sustained by cutting away wreck or parts of the
        ship which have been previously carried away or are effectively
        lost by accident shall not be made good as general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE V. VOLUNTARY STRANDING</tussenkop>
    <al>When a ship is intentionally run on shore for the common safety,
        whether or not she might have been driven on shore, the
        consequent loss or damage to the property involved in the common
        maritime adventure shall be allowed in general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE VI. SALVAGE REMUNERATION</tussenkop>
    <al>(a) Expenditure incurred by the parties to the adventure in the
        nature of salvage, whether under contract or otherwise, shall be
        allowed in general average provided that the salvage operations
        were carried out for the purpose of preserving from peril the
        property involved in the common maritime adventure.</al>
    <al>Expenditure allowed in general average shall include any salvage
        remuneration in which the skill and efforts of the salvors in
        preventing or minimising damage to the environment such as is
        referred to in Article 13 paragraph I(b) of the International
        Convention on Salvage, 1989 have been taken into account.</al>
    <al>(b) Special compensation payable to a salvor by the shipowner
        under Article 14 of the said Convention to the extent specified
        in paragraph 4 of that Article or under any other provision
        similar in substance shall not be allowed in general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE VII. DAMAGE TO MACHINERY AND BOILERS</tussenkop>
    <al>Damage caused to any machinery and boilers of a ship which is
        ashore and in a position or peril, in endeavouring to refloat,
        shall be allowed in general average when shown to have arisen
        from an actual intention to float the ship for the common safety
        at the risk of such damage; but where a ship is afloat no loss
        or damage caused by working the propelling machinery and boilers
        shall in any circumstances be made good as general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE VIII. EXPENSES LIGHTENING A SHIP WHEN ASHORE, AND
        CONSEQUENT DAMAGE</tussenkop>
    <al>When a ship is ashore and cargo and ship's fuel and stores
        or any of them are discharged as a general average act, the
        extra cost of lightening, lighter hire and reshipping (if
        incurred), and any loss or damage to the property involved in
        the common maritime adventure in consequence thereof, shall be
        admitted as general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE IX. CARGO, SHIP'S MATERIALS AND STORES USED FOR FUEL</tussenkop>
    <al>Cargo, ship's materials and stores, or any of them,
        necessarily used for fuel for the common safety at a time of
        peril shall be admitted as general average, but when such an
        allowance is made for the cost of ship's materials and
        stores the general average shall be credited with the estimated
        cost of the fuel which would otherwise have been consumed in
        prosecuting the intended voyage. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE X. EXPENSES AT PORT OF REFUGE, ETC.</tussenkop>
    <al>(a) When a ship shall have entered a port or place of refuge or
        shall have returned to her port or place of loading in
        consequence of accident, sacrifice or other extraordinary
        circumstances which render that necessary for the common safety,
        the expenses of entering such port or place shall be admitted as
        general average; and when she shall have sailed thence with her
        original cargo, or a part of it, the corresponding expenses of
        leaving such port or place consequent upon such entry or return
        shall likewise be admitted as general average.</al>
    <al>When a ship is at any port of place of refuge and is necessarily
        removed to another port or place because repairs cannot be
        carried out in the first port or place, the provisions of this
        Rule shall be applied to the second port or place as if it were
        a port or place of refuge and the cost of such removal including
        temporary repairs and towage shall be admitted as general
        average. The provisions of Rule XI shall be applied to the
        prolongation of the voyage occasioned by such removal.</al>
    <al>(b) The cost of handling on board or discharging cargo, fuel or
        stores whether at a port or place of loading, call or refuge,
        shall be admitted as general average, when the handling or
        discharge was necessary for the common safety or to enable
        damage to the ship caused by sacrifice or accident to be
        repaired, if the repairs were necessary for the safe prosecution
        of the voyage, except in cases where the damage to the ship is
        discovered at a port or place of loading or call without any
        accident or other extraordinary circumstances connected with
        such damage having taken place during the voyage.</al>
    <al>The cost of handling on board or discharging cargo, fuel or
        stores shall not be admissible as general average when incurred
        solely for the purpose of restowage due to shifting during the
        voyage, unless such restowage is necessary for the common safety.</al>
    <al>(c) Whenever the cost of handling or discharging cargo, fuel or
        stores is admissible as general average, the costs of storage,
        including insurance if reasonably incurred, reloading and
        stowing of such cargo, fuel or stores shall likewise be admitted
        as general average. The provisions of Rule XI shall be applied
        to the extra period of detention occasioned by such reloading or restowing.</al>
    <al>But when the ship is condemned or does not proceed on her
        original voyage, storage expenses shall be admitted as general
        average only up to the date of the ship's condemnation or
        of the abandonment of the voyage or up to the date of completion
        of discharge of cargo if the condemnation or abandonment takes
        place before that date. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XI. WAGES AND MAINTENANCE OF CREW AND OTHER EXPENSES
        BEARING UP FOR AND IN A PORT OF REFUGE, ETC.</tussenkop>
    <al>(a) Wages and maintenance of master, officers and crew
        reasonably incurred and fuel and stores consumed during the
        prolongation of the voyage occasioned by a ship entering a port
        or place of refuge or returning to her port or place of loading
        shall be admitted as general average when the expenses of
        entering such port or place are allowable in general average in
        accordance with Rule X(a).</al>
    <al>(b) When a ship shall have entered or been detained in any port
        or place in consequence of accident, sacrifice or other
        extraordinary circumstances which render that necessary for the
        common safety, or to enable damage to the ship caused by
        sacrifice or accident to be repaired, if the repairs were
        necessary for the safe prosecution of the voyage, the wages and
        maintenance of the master, officers and crew reasonably incurred
        during the extra period of detention in such port or place until
        the ship shall or should have been made ready to proceed upon
        her voyage, shall be admitted in general average.</al>
    <al>Fuel and stores consumed during the extra period of detention
        shall be admitted as general average, except such fuel and
        stores as are consumed in effecting repairs not allowable in
        general average. Port charges incurred during the extra period
        of detention shall likewise be admitted as general average
        except such charges as are incurred solely by reason of repairs
        not allowable in general average.</al>
    <al>Provided that when damage to the ship is discovered at a port or
        place of loading or call without any accident or other
        extraordinary circumstance connected with such damage having
        taken place during the voyage, then the wages and maintenance of
        master, officers and crew and fuel and stores consumed and port
        charges incurred during the extra detention for repairs to
        damages so discovered shall not be admissible as general
        average, even if the repairs are necessary for the safe
        prosecution of the voyage.</al>
    <al>When the ship is condemned or does not proceed on her original
        voyage, the wages and maintenance of the master, officers and
        crew and fuel and stores consumed and port charges shall be
        admitted as general average only up to the date of the
        ship's condemnation or of the abandonment of the voyage or
        up to the date of completion of discharge of cargo if the
        condemnation or abandonment takes place before that date.</al>
    <al>(c) For the purpose of this and the other Rules wages shall
        include all payments made to or for the benefit of the master,
        officers and crew, whether such payments be imposed by law upon
        the shipowners or be made under the terms or articles of employment.</al>
    <al>(d) The cost of measures undertaken to prevent or minimise
        damage to the environment shall be allowed in general average
        when incurred in any or all of the following circumstances:</al>
    <al>(i) as part of an operation performed for the common safety
        which, had it been undertaken by a party outside the common
        maritime adventure, would have entitled such party to a salvage reward;</al>
    <al>(ii) as a condition of entry into or departure from any port or
        place in the circumstances prescribed in Rule X(a);</al>
    <al>(iii) as a condition of remaining at any port or place in the
        circumstances prescribed in Rule XI(b), provided that when there
        is an actual escape or release of pollutant substances the cost
        of any additional measures required on that account to prevent
        or minimise pollution or environmental damage shall not be
        allowed as general average;</al>
    <al>(iv) necessarily in connection with the discharging, storing or
        reloading of cargo whenever the cost of those operations is
        admissible as general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XII. DAMAGE TO CARGO IN DISCHARGING, ETC.</tussenkop>
    <al>Damage to or loss of cargo, fuel or stores sustained in
        consequence of their handling, discharging, storing, reloading
        and stowing shall be made good as general average, when and only
        when the cost of those measures respectively is admitted as
        general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XIII. DEDUCTIONS FROM COST OF REPAIRS</tussenkop>
    <al>Repairs to be allowed in general average shall not be subject to
        deductions in respect of ``new for old" where old material
        or parts are replaced by new unless the ship is over fifteen
        years old in which case there shall be a deduction of one third.
        The deductions shall be regulated by the age of the ship from
        the 31st December of the year of completion of construction to
        the date of the general average act, except for insulation, life
        and similar boats, communications and navigational apparatus and
        equipment, machinery and boilers for which the deductions shall
        be regulated by the age of the particular parts to which they apply.</al>
    <al>The deductions shall be made only from the cost of the new
        material or parts when finished and ready to be installed in the ship.</al>
    <al>No deduction shall be made in respect of provisions, stores,
        anchors and chain cables.</al>
    <al>Drydock and slipway dues and costs of shifting the ship shall be
        allowed in full.</al>
    <al>The costs of cleaning, painting or coating of bottom shall not
        be allowed in general average unless the bottom has been painted
        or coated within the twelve months preceding the date of the
        general average act in which case one half of such costs shall
        be allowed. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XIV. TEMPORARY REPAIRS</tussenkop>
    <al>Where temporary repairs are effected to a ship at a port of
        loading, call of refuge, for the common safety, or of damage
        caused by general average sacrifice, the cost of such repairs
        shall be admitted as general average.</al>
    <al>Where temporary repairs of accidental damage are effected in
        order to enable the adventure to be completed, the cost of such
        repairs shall be admitted as general average without regard to
        the saving, if any, to other interests, but only up to the
        saving in expense which would have been incurred and allowed in
        general average if such repairs had not been effected there.</al>
    <al>No deductions ``new for old" shall be made from the cost of
        temporary repairs allowable as general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XV. LOSS OF FREIGHT</tussenkop>
    <al>Loss of freight arising from damage to or loss of cargo shall be
        made good as general average, either when caused by a general
        average act, or when the damage to or loss of cargo is so made good.</al>
    <al>Deduction shall be made from the amount of gross freight lost,
        of the charges which the owner thereof would have incurred to
        earn such freight, but has, in consequence of the sacrifice, not
        incurred. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XVI. AMOUNT TO BE MADE GOOD FOR CARGO LOST OR
        DAMAGED BY SACRIFICE</tussenkop>
    <al>The amount to be made good as general average for damage to or
        loss of cargo sacrificed shall be the loss which has been
        sustained thereby based on the value at the time of discharge,
        ascertained from the commercial invoice rendered to the receiver
        or if there is no such invoice from the shipped value. The value
        at the time of discharge shall include the cost of insurance and
        freight except insofar as such freight is at the risk of
        interests other than the cargo.</al>
    <al>When cargo so damaged is sold and the amount of the damage has
        not been otherwise agreed, the loss to be made good in general
        average shall be the difference between the net proceeds of sale
        and the net sound value as computed in the first paragraph of
        this Rule. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XVII. CONTRIBUTORY VALUES</tussenkop>
    <al>The contribution to a general average shall be made upon the
        actual net values of the property at the termination of the
        adventure except that the value of cargo shall be the value at
        the time of discharge, ascertained from the commercial invoice
        rendered to the receiver or if there is no such invoice from the
        shipped value. The value of the cargo shall include the cost of
        insurance and freight unless and insofar as such freight is at
        the risk of interests other than the cargo, deducting therefrom
        any loss or damage suffered by the cargo prior to or at the time
        of discharge. The value of the ship shall be assessed without
        taking into account the beneficial or detrimental effect of any
        demise or time charterparty to which the ship may be committed.</al>
    <al>To these values shall be added the amount made good as general
        average for property sacrificed, if not already included,
        deduction being made from the freight and passage money at risk
        of such charges and crew's wages as would not have been
        incurred in earning the freight had the ship and cargo been
        totally lost at the date of the general average act and have not
        been allowed as general average; deduction being also made from
        the value of the property to all extra charges incurred in
        respect thereof subsequently to the general average act, except
        such charges as are allowed in general average or fall upon the
        ship by virtue of an award for special compensation under
        Article 14 of the International Convention on Salvage, 1989 or
        under any other provision similar in substance.</al>
    <al>In the circumstances envisaged in the third paragraph of Rule G,
        the cargo and other property shall contribute on the basis of
        its value upon delivery at original destination unless sold or
        otherwise disposed of short of that destination, and the ship
        shall contribute upon its actual net value at the time of
        completion of discharge of cargo.</al>
    <al>Where cargo is sold short of destination, however, it shall
        contribute upon the actual net proceeds of sale, with the
        addition of any amount made good as general average.</al>
    <al>Mails, passengers' luggage, personal effects and
        accompanied private motor vehicles shall not contribute in
        general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XVIII. DAMAGE TO SHIP</tussenkop>
    <al>The amount to be allowed as general average for damage or loss
        to the ship, her machinery and/or gear caused by a general
        average act shall be as follows:</al>
    <al>(a) When repaired or replaced,</al>
    <al>The actual reasonable cost of repairing or replacing such damage
        or loss, subject to deductions in accordance with Rule XIII.</al>
    <al>(b) When not repaired or replaced,</al>
    <al>The reasonable depreciation arising from such damage or loss,
        but not exceeding the estimated cost of repairs. But where the
        ship is an actual total loss or when the cost of repairs of the
        damage would exceed the value of the ship when repaired, the
        amount to be allowed as general average shall be the difference
        between the estimated sound value of the ship after deducting
        therefrom the estimated cost of repairing damage which is not
        general average and the value of the ship in her damaged state
        which may be measured by the net proceeds of sale, if any. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XIX. UNDECLARED OR WRONGFULLY DECLARED CARGO</tussenkop>
    <al>Damage or loss caused to goods loaded without the knowledge of
        the shipowner or his agent or to goods wilfully misdescribed at
        time of shipment shall not be allowed as general average, but
        such goods shall remain liable to contribute, if saved.</al>
    <al>Damage or loss caused to goods which have been wrongfully
        declared on shipment at a value which is lower than their real
        value shall be contributed for at the declared value, but such
        goods shall contribute upon their actual value.  </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XX. PROVISION OF FUNDS</tussenkop>
    <al>A commission of&#xA0;2 per cent on general average disbursements,
        other than the wages and maintenance of master, officers and
        crew and fuel and stores not replaced during the voyage, shall
        be allowed in general average.</al>
    <al>The capital loss sustained by the owners of goods sold for the
        purpose of raising funds to defray general average disbursements
        shall be allowed in general average.</al>
    <al>The cost of insuring general average disbursements shall also be
        admitted in general average. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XXI. INTEREST ON LOSSES MADE GOOD IN GENERAL AVERAGE</tussenkop>
    <al>Interest shall be allowed on expenditure, sacrifices and
        allowances in general average at the rate of&#xA0;7 per cent per
        annum, until three months after the date of issue of the general
        average adjustment, due allowance being made for any payment on
        account by the contributory interests or from the general
        average deposit fund. </al>
    <tussenkop>RULE XXII. TREATMENT OF CASH DEPOSITS</tussenkop>
    <al>Where cash deposits have been collected in respect of
        cargo's liability for general average, salvage or special
        charges, such deposits shall be paid without any delay into a
        special account in the joint names of a representative nominated
        on behalf of the shipowner and a representative nominated on
        behalf of the depositors in a bank to be approved by both. The
        sum so deposited, together with accrued interest, if any, shall
        be held as security for payment to the parties entitled thereto
        of the general average, salvage or special charges payable by
        cargo in respect to which the deposits have been collected.
        Payments on account or refunds of deposits may be made if
        certified to in writing by the average adjuster. Such deposits
        and payments or refunds shall be without prejudice to the
        ultimate liability of the parties.</al>
