The States participating in the Conference are determined to achieve the high purposes embodied in the United Nations Charter &#x201C;to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom&#x201D;;<noot type="voet"><noot.nr>1)</noot.nr><noot.al> Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations.</noot.al></noot>  to seek a better and more effective system of international economic co-operation, whereby the division of the world into areas of poverty and plenty may be banished and prosperity achieved by all; and to find ways by which the human and material resources of the world may be harnessed for the abolition of poverty everywhere. In an age when scientific progress has put unprecedented abundance within man's reach, is is essential that the flows of world trade should help to eliminate the wide economic disparities among nations. The international community must combine its efforts to ensure that all countries - regardless of size, of wealth, of economic and social system - enjoy the benefits of international trade for their economic development and social progress.</al></li><li><al>2. Recognizing that universal peace and prosperity are closely linked and that the economic growth of the developing countries will also contribute to the economic growth of the developed countries, realizing the danger of a widening gulf in living standards between peoples, and convinced of the benefits of international co-operation with a view to helping the developing countries to reach a higher standard of life, the States signatories of this Final Act are resolved, in a sense of human solidarity, &#x201C;to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples&#x201D; <noot type="voet"><noot.nr>1)</noot.nr><noot.al> Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations.</noot.al></noot>.</al></li><li><al>3. In endorsing the decision to convene the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the General Assembly of the United Nations was motivated by certain basic considerations. Economic and social progress throughout the world depends in large measure on a steady expansion in international trade. The extensive development of equitable and mutually advantageous international trade creates a good basis for the establishment of neighbourly relations between States, helps to strengthen peace and an atmosphere of mutual confidence and understanding among nations, and promotes higher living standards and more rapid economic progress in all countries of the world. Finally, the accelerated economic development of the developing countries depends largely on a substantial increase in their share in international trade.</al></li><li><al>4. The task of development, which implies a complex of structural changes in the economic and social environment in which men live, is for the benefit of the people as a whole. The developing countries are already engaged in a determined attempt to achieve, by their own efforts, a breakthrough into self-sustaining economic growth which furthers social progress. These efforts must continue and be enlarged. Economic and social progress should go together. If privilege, extremes of wealth and poverty, and social injustice persist, then the goal of development is lost. If the social and cultural dimension of development is ignored, economic advance alone can bring no abiding benefit.</al></li><li><al>5. The developing countries recognize that they have the primary responsibility to raise the living standards of their peoples; but their national exertions to this end will be greatly impaired if not supplemented and strengthened by constructive international action based on respect for national sovereignty. An essential element of such action is that international policies in the field of trade and development should result in a modified international division of labour which is more rational and equitable and is accompanied by the necessary adjustments in world production and trade. The resultant increase in productivity and purchasing power of the developing countries will contribute to the economic growth of the industrialized countries as well, and thus become a means to world-wide prosperity.</al></li><li><al>6. The issues before the Conference have been at once challenging and urgent. While there are varying degrees of development, the joint income of the developing countries, with two-thirds of the world's population, is not much more than one-tenth of that of the industrialized countries. Moreover, the dramatic increase in the population of the developing countries multiplies the difficulties they face in assuring to their peoples even the simplest elements of a decent human life. The aim must be to create jointly new trade and new wealth, so as to share a common prosperity, and thereby avoid the waste and other unfavourable consequences of closed paths to development. The international community is called upon to join in a constructive and universal policy of co-operation for trade and development which will further economic progress throughout the world.</al></li><li><al>7. The designation of the nineteen-sixties as the United Nations Development Decade was a recognition of deep world-wide concern with the urgent necessity of raising the standard of living of the developing countries and an earnest of the resolve of the United Nations, working together, to accomplish this task. Wide concern has been expressed regarding the inadequacy of the Decade's objective of a minimum rate of growth of aggregate national income of 5 per cent per annum by 1970. To attain even this rate of growth it is essential that measures and action be taken by both the developing and the developed countries, including measures to raise the level and accelerate the rate of growth of earnings of the developing countries from trade, as a means of helping them to overcome their persistent external imbalance.</al></li><li><al>8. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was convened in order to provide, by means of international cooperation, appropriate solutions to the problems of world trade in the interest of all peoples and particularly to the urgent trade and development problems of the developing countries. In a period when their need for imports of development goods and for technical knowledge has been increasing, developing countries have been faced with a situation in which their export earnings and capacity to import goods and services have been inadequate. The growth in import requirements has not been matched by a commensurate expansion in export earnings. The resultant trade gap, which gold and foreign exchange reserves have been inadequate to bridge, has had to be filled very largely by capital imports. This in itself cannot provide a complete or permanent solution, and indeed the servicing of external debts and the outgoings on other &#x201C;invisible&#x201D; items themselves present severe burdens for developing countries. Moreover, the terms of trade have operated to the disadvantage of the developing countries. In recent years many developing countries have been faced with declining prices for their exports of primary commodities at a time when prices of their imports of manufactured goods, particularly capital equipment, have increased. This, together with the heavy dependence of individual developing countries on primary commodity exports has reduced their capacity to import. Unless these and other unfavourable trends are changed in the near future, the efforts of the developing countries to develop, diversify and industrialize their economies will be seriously hampered.</al></li><li><al>9. Deeply sensible of the urgency of the problems with which the Conference has dealt, the States participating in this Conference, taking note of the recommendations of the Conference, are determined to do their utmost to lay the foundations of a better world economic order.</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">II</nr><titel status="officieel">CONSTITUTION AND PROCEEDINGS</titel></kop><lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>10. When, in the third week of December 1961, the General Assembly of the United Nations designated the current decade as &#x201C;the United Nations Development Decade&#x201D;, it also asked the Secretary-General to consult members on the advisability of convening an international conference on international trade problems. Both resolutions (1707 (XVI) and 1710 (XVI)) sprang from the growing conviction that the economic aims of the Charter would best be furthered by a bold new programme of international economic cooperation; and it was in this conviction that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development had its origin.</al></li><li><al>11. The Cairo Conference on the Problems of Economic Development held in July 1962 issued a Declaration (which was later welcomed by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 1820 XVII)) strongly recommending the early convening of an international conference on trade and development. The idea of such a Conference having gained ground, the General Assembly of the United Nations endorsed, on 8 December 1962 (resolution 1785 (XVII)), the decision taken in August 1962 by the Economic and Social Council (resolution 917 (XXXIV)) whereby the Council resolved to convene this Conference and to establish a Preparatory Committee to consider its agenda. The Secretary-General was requested to invite all States Members of the United Nations and members of the specialized agencies and of the International Atomic Energy Agency to take part in the Conference. The deliberations of the Preparatory Committee's three sessions<noot type="voet"><noot.nr>2)</noot.nr><noot.al>The first session of the Preparatory Committee took place at United Nations Headquarters from 22 January to 5 February 1963; the second was held at the European Office of the United Nations, at Geneva, from 21 May to 29 June 1963; and the third session was at United Nations Headquarters from 3 to 15 February 1964. At its third session, the Committee decided that informal closed meetings should be held prior to the opening of the Conference. These pre-Conference meetings were held in Geneva from 18 to 23 March 1964.</noot.al></noot>   were fruitful: a detailed provisional agenda for the Conference was drawn up, and a report was prepared defining the problems to be examined and suggesting the directions in which possible solutions might be sought. At the Committee's request the secretariats of the United Nations family of organizations prepared many studies of the issues involved. The Secretary-General of the Conference sought the advice of governments and scholars, and prepared his report entitled <nadruk type="cur">Towards a New Trade Policy for Development</nadruk>.  Member States, individually and in groups, also submitted useful proposals and suggestions to the Conference.</al></li><li><al>12. On 18 July 1963, the Economic and Social Council decided that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should be held in Geneva, beginning on 23 March 1964 and continuing until 15 June 1964, and approved the provisional agenda drawn up by the Preparatory Committee (Economic and Social Council resolution 963 (XXXVI)). By its resolution of 11 November 1963 the General Assembly (resolution 1897 (XVIII)) noted the work of the Preparatory Committee and of the Secretary-General of the Conference, welcomed the Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries<noot type="voet"><noot.nr>3)</noot.nr><noot.al> The Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries was adopted at the same time as, and forms an annex to, the General Assembly resolution in question.</noot.al></noot> , and invited States to give serious consideration to it. The regional economic commissions and other regional organizations considered questions of trade and development and adopted important resolutions and declarations <noot type="voet"><noot.nr>4)</noot.nr><noot.al>See the reports relating to the Brasilia meeting convened by the Economic Commission for Latin America (E/CONF.46/60 and 71) and the Alta Gracia Charter approved by the Special Latin American Co-ordinating Committee of the Organization of American States, (E/CONF.46/100) the resolutions adopted by the Economic Commission for Africa (E/CONF .46/82) and by the Economic and Social Commission of African Unity at Niamey (E/CONF.46/107), the resolution of the Economic Commission for Europe (E/CONF.46/46) and the Teheran resolutions of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (E/CONF.46/87).</noot.al></noot>. Meanwhile, as the practical arrangements for the Conference went forward, the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council were the principal forum for debates expressing the high hopes vested by the peoples of the United Nations in the Conference as a potential turning point in international co-operation in the field of trade and development.</al></li><li><al>13. Aware of these high hopes, the representatives of the following one hundred and twenty<noot type="voet"><noot.nr>5)</noot.nr><noot.al> Somalia and Western Samoa were invited, but did not attend the Conference.</noot.al></noot> States gathered in Geneva from 23 March to 16 June 1964 to take part in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development:</al>

The inaugural address was delivered by the President of Switzerland; the Secretary-General of the United Nations also addressed the Conference; and messages of goodwill and good wishes for success were received from numerous Heads of State. After adopting its agenda and electing its officers - a President, twenty-seven Vice-Presidents, and a Rapporteur - the Conference was addressed by its President and heard, over a period of twelve days, an address by its Secretary-General and a series of policy statements by heads of delegations, most of whom were Cabinet ministers, and by representatives of a number of inter-governmental economic organizations. Five Committees of the whole were established for detailed study of the items of the agenda. The General Committee of the Conference comprised the President, the Vice-Presidents, the Rapporteur, and the Chairman of the five Committees. The Conference also established a Drafting Committee for the Final Act.</al></li><li><al>15. With a view to reaching agreement on the issues before the Conference, many informal meetings were held and important consultations conducted among groups of delegations. A notable feature of the Conference was the fact that the delegations of the States signatories of the Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries co-ordinated their work with a view to enhancing general co-operation among all delegations.</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">III</nr><titel status="officieel">FINDINGS</titel></kop>
							<al>The Conference has been guided by the following findings:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>16. World trade has expanded substantially in recent years: the value of world exports has more than doubled since 1950. The principal impulse for this growth has been provided by the overall expansion of the world economy, aided by national and international action as well as enormous scientific and technical progress and the social and economic changes in the world.</al></li><li><al>17. The countries of the world did not share proportionately in this expansion of international trade. While exports of developing countries rose from $ 19.2 billion to $ 28.9 billion between 1950 and 1962, that is by 50 per cent, the expansion of exports from these countries proceeded at an appreciably lower rate than that of developed countries. As a result, the share of developing countries in world exports declined steadily from nearly one-third in 1950 to only slightly more than one-fifth in 1962. Concurrently, the developed market economies increased their share from three-fifths to two-thirds, and the centrally planned economies from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. One of the reasons for the decline in the rate of expansion of world exports from 8.4 per cent per annum in the early fifties to rather less than 5 per cent in the early sixties is the inability of the developing countries to attain a higher rate of export expansion.</al></li><li><al>18. The difficulties experienced by developing countries in increasing the sale of their products at remunerative prices in the markets of most of the highly industrialized countries have placed a limit on the extent to which they can purchase capital goods and machinery from the developed countries, which in turn has contributed to a slower rate of expansion of world trade than would have been the case if the developing countries had been enabled to increase their exports at a faster rate. Further, measures having discriminatory or protectionist effects applied by certain developed countries have hampered the development of the trade of developing countries and of world trade in general.</al></li><li><al>19. The difficulties of developing countries were aggravated by deterioration in their terms of trade during the period 1950-1962. The slower growth in the quantity of exports of the developing countries and the adverse movement of their terms of trade were largely the reflexion of the present commodity composition of their trade, consisting, as is does, predominantly of the exchange of primary product exports for manufactured imports whose relative positions in world markets have undergone significant changes. World trade in manufactures has been increasing at an annual rate more than twice that of trade in primary products. Factors contributing to the sluggishness of primary product exports include the low response of consumer demand for food to increases in income of consumers in the advanced countries where incomes and food consumption are already high, the widespread use of substitutes and synthetics, and the increasing output of primary products in advanced countries which has been the result both of domestic policies, in many cases reinforced by protective barriers, as well as a general increase in productivity stemming from technological progress. These long-term trends have been accentuated by short-term fluctuations in export earnings caused by economic recessions and other factors.</al></li><li><al>20. The deterioration in terms of trade and the sluggish expansion of the export quantum of developing countries occurred at a time when their need for imported supplies to speed up the pace of their economic development sharply increased. There is a close link between the rate of economic growth and the available supply of investment goods. The developing countries require a specific increase in the supply of investment goods in order to achieve the Development Decade target. Since their domestic capacity to produce these goods is limited, a substantial amount of such goods has to be imported. Imports have to be financed through export receipts and inflows of capital from abroad. Thus, the resources required for a higher rate of growth would obviously have to be sougth in additional export earnings and an increase in the net inflow of long-term public and private funds.</al></li><li><al>21. The developing countries' surplus of exports over imports in 1950 became a deficit in 1962 of $ 2.3 billion, while their net payments for investment income and other invisibles were about $ 3.3 billion around 1960. This deficit was covered by the provision of aid and other capital flows. However, the gap between the import requirements of developing countries and their export earnings has been widening According to United Nations Secretariat estimates, this gap could be of the order of $ 20 billion a year in 1970, on the basis of a 5 per cent per annum rate of growth set as the target for the United Nations Development Decade, assuming no change in the trends of the fifties upon which these estimates were based.</al></li><li><al>22. In recent years, the developing countries have been turning increasingly to economic and social planning as the most effective means for accelerating their growth. Their plans, policies and institutions are designed to achieve the transformation of their economic and social structures and to provide for maximum saving, investment and output to a pre-determined order of priorities for a targeted rate of growth. However realistic the plans drawn up by the developing countries may be, their realization is hindered by the instability of international markets for primary products and by conditions restricting the access of primary commodities and semi-manufactures and manufactures to the markets of the developed countries. The continued dependence on the export of a single product or a few commodities whose prices have been declining in the past has made the realization of the development plans all the more difficult. The realization of economic and social development plans of the developing countries necessitates an appropriate change in the present structure of international trade in such a way as to afford them the opportunity of earning adequate and stable supplies of foreign exchange.</al></li><li><al>23. An overwhelming proportion - over two-thirds - of the import and export trade of developing countries is with the developed market economies. Between 1950 and 1962 the total exports of the developed market economies to the developing countries increased by 98 per cent, rising from $ 10,650 million to $ 21,060 million. This contrasted with the exports of the developing countries to the developing market countries, which increased by 56 per cent, rising from $ 13,220 million to $ 20,660 million.</al></li><li><al>24. The reason for the failure of export of the developing countries to the developed market economies to expand at a faster rate can be attributed to a number of factors. Reference has already been made in the foregoing passages to contributory factors of a general character. Specific policies include price-support programmes, customs duties and internal taxes and fiscal charges imposed on the consumption of tropical products, export subsidies on commodities of Interest to developing countries, and higher levels of tariffs imposed on processed products relative to those applied to such products when exported in their natural form. These factors have contributed to the sluggishness of the demand for the products of developing countries and in the case of some commodities to the accumulation of surpluses which have tended to exercise a depressing effect on world commodity prices. There is need for the elimination of these obstacles by national and international action designed to improve access and expand market opportunities for the exports of primary products, semi-manufactures and manufactures of developing countries in order to increase their export earnings.</al></li><li><al>25. Owing to its relatively recent origin, trade between developing countries and the centrally planned economies is so far limited to a relatively small number of countries and constitutes a small part of the trade turnover of developing countries as a whole. In 1962, $ 1,630 million, or 5.6 per cent of the total exports of the developing countries went to the centrally planned economies, while imports from the latter into the former totalled $ 2,150 million and formed 7.3 per cent of total imports. This trade has, however, shown a tendency to increase rapidly in recent years. Thus, in terms of value, the exports of the countries with centrally planned economies to developing countries increased from $ 405 million to $ 2,150 million, or by 430 per cent, between 1950 and 1962, while exports from the developing countries to the countries with centrally planned economies showed an expansion from $ 610 million to $ 1,630 million, or by 167 per cent, over the same period.</al></li><li><al>26. The expansion in trade has been secured mainly through medium and long-term bilateral trade agreements which stipulate the quantity and/or the value of goods to be exchanged. In spite of the rapidity of growth in trade between the two groups of countries, there is still considerable scope for expansion, which can be secured through the removal of certain obstacles which prevent a faster rate of growth and by further positive measures taken by the interested countries. The major obstacles arise from the fact that trade relations have not yet been established between many developing countries and centrally planned economies, the need, in some cases, due to the bilateral trade system, for individual developing countries to balance their trade with individual centrally planned economies and the paucity of knowledge among public and private organizations of trade partners in some developing countries about the products and the trade policies and practices of the centrally planned economies.</al></li><li><al>27. These problems can be solved and trade between countries of the two groups expanded at a more rapid rate through the establishment of normal trade relations between centrally planned economies and a larger number of developing countries; through the granting by countries with centrally planned economies to developing countries, within the framework of the former's foreign trade system, of special advantages conducive to the promotion of such trade; through the adoption by the centrally planned economies, within the framework of their long-term plans, of appropriate measures to secure the diversification and a proportionately increasing growth of their imports of primary, semi-manufactured and manufactured products from developed countries; and through increased utilization by centrally planned economies, in addition to bilateral arrangements, of multilateral trade and payment methods, when these are considered to be of mutual advantage to all partners in the trade. Developing countries for their part should accord the countries with centrally planned economies conditions for trade not inferior to those granted normally to the developed market economy countries.</al></li><li><al>28. Trade between the centrally planned countries and the developed market economies has grown rapidly in recent years. The full potentiality of this trade, however, has not been realized because of administrative, economic and trade policy obstacles. Efforts to discover means to solve these problems and increase trade to the mutual benefit of all partners concerned and thus achieve levels of trade commensurate with the apparent possibilities, have shown increasing progress in recent years.</al></li><li><al>29. Continuation of such efforts in whatever available forums, including within the framework of the future institutional arrangements recommended by the Conference, should result in progressively greater levels of trade between countries having different economic and social systems. It is recognized that such a development would be in the interest of world trade as a whole.</al></li><li><al>30. While trade between developed countries in increasing and while the share of such exchanges in total world trade is also rising, the level of trade between developing countries is very low and its importance in world trade has been decreasing. The expansion of inter and intra-regional trade is important to developing countries insofar as it provides them with wider markets for their products and enables them to further diversify their trade and to save on scarce foreign exchange. Hence, the establishment of closer and broader trade ties between developing countries is necessary.</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">IV</nr><titel status="officieel">REASONS AND CONSIDERATIONS</titel></kop><al>In drawing up its recommendations, the Conference has been guided by the following essential reasons and considerations:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(31) The development of equitable and mutually advantageous trade can promote higher standards of living, full employment and rapid economic progress in all countries of the world.</al></li><li><al>(32) The fundamental problems of developing countries are well identified and what is now required is a universal readiness to act and generally to adopt practical measures aimed at increasing exports and exports earnings of developing countries and accelerating their economic development.</al></li><li><al>(33) At the root of the foreign trade difficulties facing the developing countries and other countries highly dependent on a narrow range of primary commodities are the slow rate of growth of demand for their exports of primary commodities, accounting for 90 per cent of their exports, the increasing participation of developed countries in world trade in primary commodities, and the deterioration in the terms of trade of developing countries from 1950 to 1962.</al></li><li><al>(34) During the period of structural readjustments of their economies, the developing countries will remain heavily dependent on commodity exports to meet growing import needs involved in the process of industrialization and diversification.</al></li><li><al>(35) Because of the outstanding importance of commodity trade for economic development, particularly of the developing countries and the special difficulties affecting trade in primary commodities, it is important and urgent that action be taken over a wide front and on dynamic and comprehensive lines so as to conduct a concerted attack on international commodity problems.</al></li><li><al>(36) There is accordingly a need deliberate effort on the part of all industrialized countries to remedy the adverse tendencies in question.</al></li><li><al>(37) This comprehensive action should include international commodity arrangements as one of the means of stimulating a dynamic and steady growth of the real export earnings of the developing countries so as to provide them with expanding resources for their economic and social development and of securing overall stabilization in primary commodity markets. It is also necessary to accelerate the removal of existing obstacles and to forestall the creation of new obstacles to commodity trade.</al></li><li><al>(38) Compensatory financing is an appropriate solution to meet the serious residual problems caused by short-term fluctuations in the prices of and earnings from primary commodity exports. For residual long-term problems financial solutions should be sought.</al></li><li><al>(39) The developing countries should not rely merely on the expansion of traditional exports of primary products and raw materials. Promotion of industries with an export potential in developing countries is essential. Diversification and expansion of exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods are among the important means to assist the developing countries to achieve in time a balance in their external accounts.</al></li><li><al>(40) The establishment and expansion in developing countries of industries with an export potential call for a whole series of interrelated measures and action on the part of the developing countries within the framework of overall planning, as well as by developed countries and appropriate international organizations.</al></li><li><al>(41) The role of the public sector in the economic development of developing countries is recognized, as well as the role of private capital, domestic and foreign.</al></li><li><al>(42) Developing countries face obstacles and difficulties in marketing their manufactures and semi-manufactures in the developed countries. In order to facilitate the industrial exports of developing countries, their products should have freer access particularly to the markets of the developed countries, but also to the markets of other developing countries.</al></li><li><al>(43) Easier access to markets should be provided not only for existing and traditional exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures, but also for a wider range of products in order to improve the opportunities for the establishment in the developing countries of a wider range of industries more technically evolved and producing industrial goods of higher degrees of complexity.</al></li><li><al>(44) Substantial imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures may involve some re-adjustment in the industrial structures of the developed countries.</al></li><li><al>(45) A lowering of trade barriers would improve the competitive position of the developing countries relative to that of domestic producers in the market of each developed country, but it would not improve their competitive position in that market in relation to exports from other developed countries. Special measures in favour of exports from developing countries would be needed to bring about the required expansion of such exports.</al></li><li><al>(46) In addition to the expansion of exports of manufactures to developed countries, the expansion of such trade among the developing countries themselves would contribute towards solving the dilemma posed by the economic and technological requirements of modern industry on the one hand and the limited domestic markets of individual countries on the other. Because of the many forms which economic co-operation might have in various cases and the problems which they might cause, it is considered that a certain flexibility is needed.</al></li><li><al>(47) The Conference has considered the general targets on which the international community might focus in dealing with the problems of development through trade and international co-operation. A number of principles and criteria aimed at providing constructive guide-lines for policies in the various areas of international financial and technical co-operation have been formulated. The major questions identified are as follows:</al>

							</li><li><al>(48) There is wide recognition of the importance and gravity of the problem posed by the financing of development, in all its many complex aspects, and this recognition should form the basis for continuing reviews and action in this field.</al></li><li><al>(49) There is also recognition of the need for greater and more systematic efforts by all parties involved, with a fair division of responsibilities among developed and developing countries, in order to engender the necessary co-operative efforts at the national, regional and international levels.</al></li><li><al>(50) More specifically, there is wide agreement in some key areas which, though necessarily limited in scope, constituted forward steps. These areas include measures for accelerated growth in developing countries and increase in foreign exchange availabilities; guide-lines for international financial and technical co-operation, compensatory financing and supplementary financial measures, and for dealing with external debt problems; and some aspects of shipping in relation to the trade of developing countries.</al></li><li><al>(51) Finally, in some other areas, there is also agreement that specific measures which have been proposed should be given further consideration or should be studied by the appropriate international organizations.</al></li><li><al>52. In approaching the problem of institutional arrangements, the Conference has taken into account the fact that sustained efforts are necessary to raise the standards of living in all countries and to accelerate the economic growth of developing countries, and that international trade is an important instrument for economic development. The Conference has provided a unique opportunity to make a comprehensive review of the problems of trade and of trade in relation to economic development, particularly those problems affecting the developing countries. Is has recognized adequate and effectively functioning organizational arrangements are essential if the full contribution of international trade to the accelerated growth of the developing countries is to be successfully realized through the formulation and implementation of the necessary policies.</al></li><li><al>53. To this end, the Conference has examined the operation of existing international institutions and has recognized both their contributions and theid limitations in dealing with all the problems of trade and related problems of development. It believes that participating governments should make the most effective use of institutions and arrangements to which they are or may become parties, and is convinced, at the same time, that there should be a further review of both the present and the proposed institutional arrangements, in the light of the experience of their work and activities. The Conference has further taken note of the widespread desire among developing countries for a comprehensive trade organization, and has recognized that further institutional arrangements are necessary in order to continue the work initiated by this Conference and to implement its recommendations and conclusions.</al></li></lijst></divisie>

The Conference has recommended the following General Principles to govern international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development:</al><tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle One</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>Economic relations between countries, including trade relations, shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality of states, self-determination of peoples, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Two</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>There shall be no discrimination on the basis of differences in socio-economic systems. Adaptation of trading methods shall be consistent with this principle.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Three</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>Every country has the sovereign right freely to trade with other countries, and freely to dispose of its natural resources in the interest of the economic development and well-being of its own people.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Four</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>Economic development and social progress should be the common concern of the whole international community and should by increasing economic prosperity and well-being help strengthen peaceful relations and co-operation among nations. Accordingly, all countries pledge themselves to pursue internal and external economic policies designed to accelerate economic growth throughout the world, and in particular to help promote in developing countries a rate of growth consistent with the need to bring about substantial and steady increase in average income in order to narrow the gap between the standard of living in developing countries and that in the developed countries.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Five</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>National and international economic policies should be directed towards the attainment of an international division of labour in harmony with the needs and interests of developing countries in particular and of the world as a whole. Developed countries should assist the developing countries in their efforts to speed up their economic and social progress, should co-operate in measures taken by developing countries for diversifying their economies and should encourage appropriate adjustments in their own economies to this end.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Six</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>International trade is one of the most important factors in economic development. It should be governed by such rules as are consistent with the attainment of economic and social progress and should not be hampered by measures incompatible therewith. All countries should co-operate in creating conditions of international trade conducive in particular to the achievement of a rapid increase in the export earnings of developing countries and in general to the promotion of an expansion and diversification of trade between all countries, whether at similar levels of development, at different levels of development, or having different economic and social systems.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Seven</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>The expansion and diversification of international trade depend upon increasing access to markets, and upon remunerative prices for the exports of primary products. Developed countries shall progressively reduce and, in appropriate cases, eliminate barriers and other restrictions that hinder trade and consumption of products of particular interest to developing countries and take positive measures such as will create and increase markets for the exports of developing countries. All countries should co-operate through suitable international arrangements on an orderly basis in implementing measures designed to increase and stabilize primary commodity export earnings, particularly of developing countries, at equitable and remunerative prices and to maintain a mutually acceptable relationship between the prices of manufactured goods and those of primary products.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Eight</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>International trade should be conducted to mutual advantage on the basis of the most favoured nation treatment and should be free from measures detrimental to the trading interests of other countries. However, developed countries should grant concessions to all developing countries and extend to developing countries all concessions they grant to one another and should not in granting these or other concessions, require any concessions in return from developing countries. New preferential concessions, both tariff and non-tariff, should be made to developing countries as a whole and such preferences should not be extended to developed countries. Developing countries need to extend to developed countries preferential treatment in operation amongst them. Special preferences at present enjoyed by certain developing countries in certain developed countries should be regarded as transitional and subject to progressive reduction. They should be eliminated as and when effective international measures guaranteeing at least equivalent advantages to the countries concerned come into operation.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Nine</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>Developed countries participating in regional economic groupings should do their utmost to ensure that their economic integration does not cause injury to, or otherwise adversely affect, the expansion of their imports from third countries, and in particular from developing countries, either individually or collectively.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Ten</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>Regional economic groupings, integration or other forms of economic co-operation should be promoted among developing countries as a means of expanding their intra-regional and extra-regional trade and encouraging their economic growth and their industrial and agricultural diversification with due regard to the special features of development of the various countries concerned as well as their economic and social systems. It will be necessary to ensure that such co-operation makes an effective contribution to the economic development of these countries, and does not inhibit the economic development of other developing countries outside such groupings.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Eleven</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>International institutions and developed countries should provide an increasing net flow of international financial, technical and economic assistance to support and reinforce, by supplementing the export earnings of developing countries, the efforts made by them to accelerate their economic growth through diversification, industrialization and increase of productivity on the basis of their national policies, plans and programmes of economic development. Such assistance should not be subject to any political or military conditions. This assistance, whatever its form and from whatever source, including foreign public and private loans and capital, should flow to developing countries on terms fully in keeping with their trade and development needs. International financial and monetary policies should be designed to take full account of the trade and development needs of developing countries.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Twelve</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>All countries recognize that a significant portion of resources released in successive stages as a result of the conclusion of an agreement on general and complete disarmament under effective international control should be allocated to the promotion of economic development in developing countries.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Thirteen</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>The Conference decided to include, as a separate part of the Principles adopted by the Conference, the Principles relating to transit trade of land-locked countries set forth below.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Fourteen</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>Complete decolonization in compliance with the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the liquidation of the remnants of colonialism in all its forms is a necessary condition for economic development and the exercise of sovereign rights over natural resources.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">General Principle Fifteen</nadruk> 
							</tussenkop>
							<al>The adoption of international policies and measures for the economic development of the developing countries shall take into account the individual characteristics and different stages of development of the developing countries, special attention being paid to the less developed among them, as an effective means of ensuring sustained growth with equitable opportunity for each developing country.</al>
							</li><li><al>2. The Conference has recommended a number of Special Principles to govern international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development (see Annex A.I.1.).</al></li><li><al>3. The Conference has adopted the following recommendation on Principles relating to transit trade of land-locked countries:</al><al>
								<nadruk type="vet">The Conference,</nadruk></al>
							<al>
								<nadruk type="cur">Having regard</nadruk>  to the various aspects of the problem of transit trade of land-locked States,</al>
							<al>
								<nadruk type="cur">Considering</nadruk>  that for the promotion of the economic development of the land-locked States, it is essential to provide facilities to enable them to overcome the effects of their land-locked position on their trade,</al>
							<al>
								<nadruk type="cur">Adopts</nadruk>  the following principles together with the Interpretative Note:</al>
							
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle I</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>The recognition of the right of each land-locked State of free access to the sea is an essential principle for the expansion of international trade and economic development.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle II</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>In territorial and on internal waters, vessels flying the flag of landlocked countries should have identical rights and enjoy treatment identical to that enjoyed by vessels flying the flag of coastal States, other than the territorial State.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle III</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>In order to enjoy the freedom of the seas on equal terms with
coastal States, States having no sea coast should have free access
to the sea. To this end States situated between the sea and a State
having no sea coast shall by common agreement with the latter and
in conformity with existing international conventions accord to ships
flying the flag of that State treatment equal to that accorded to their
own ships or to the ships of any other State as regards access to sea
ports and the use of such ports.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle IV</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>In order to promote fully the economic development of the landlocked countries, the said countries should be afforded by all States, on the basis of reciprocity, free and unrestricted transit, in such a manner that they have free access to regional and international trade in all circumstances and for every type of goods.</al>
							<al>Goods in transit should not be subject to any customs duty.</al>
							<al>Means of transport in transit should not be subject to special taxes or charges higher thans those levied for the use of means of transport of the transit country.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle V</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>The State of transit, while maintaining full sovereignty over its territory shall have the right to take all indispensable measures to ensure that the exercise of the right of free and unrestricted transit shall in no way infringe its legitimate interests of any kind.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle VI</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>In order to accelerate the evolution of a universal approach to the solution of the special and particular problems of trade and development of land-locked countries in the different geographical areas, the conclusion of regional and other international agreements in this regard should be encouraged by all States.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle VII</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>The facilities and special rights accorded to land-locked countries in view of their special geographical position are excluded from the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="vet">
								<nadruk type="vet">Principle VIII</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>The principles which govern the right of free access to the sea of the land-locked State shall in no way abrogate existing agreements between two or more contracting parties concerning the problems, nor shall they raise an obstacle as regards the conclusion of such agreements in the future, provided that the latter do not establish a regime which is less favourable than or opposed to the abovementioned provisions.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="halfvet">INTERPRETATIVE NOTE</tussenkop>
							<al>These Principles are inter-related and each Principle should be construed in the context of the other Principles.</al>
							</li><li><al>4. In the light of its adoption of principles governing international trade relations and trade policies conducive to development, the Conference has recognized the necessity of achieving the broadest possible measure of agreement at the earliest possible moment on a set of Principles, and has recommended that the institutional machinery proposed by the Conference should continue efforts to that end (see Annex A.I.3.).</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">II</nr><titel status="officieel">INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY PROBLEMS</titel></kop><lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>5. In order to deal with the problems facing the primary commodity trade of developing countries the Conference has recommended that the provisions outlined below should be considered as means of increasing the export earnings of the developing countries by general measures as well as by specific measures related to individual commodities and, that, to this end, practical steps should be taken by governments concerned to implement at the earliest possible date those of the following provisions which are applicable in the light of certain considerations (see Annex A.II.1), as solutions of the urgent problems of developing countries.</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(a) Provisions for international commodity arrangements with a basic objective of stimulating a dynamic and steady growth and ensuring reasonable predictability in the real export earnings of the developing countries so as to provide them with expanding resources for their economic and social development, while taking into account the interests of consumers in importing countries, through remunerative, equitable and stable prices for primary commodities, having due regard to their import purchasing power, assured satisfactory access and increased imports and consumption, as well as co-ordination of production and marketing policies (see Annexes A.II.1 and A.II.2);</al></li><li><al>(b) Provisions for a programme of measures and actions for the removal of obstacles (tariff, non-tariff and other) and discriminatory practices and for expansion of market opportunities for primary commodity exports and for increases in their consumption and imports in developed countries (see Annex A.II.1 and A.II.2.).</al></li></lijst></li><li><al>6. The Conference has given general approval to the establishment of a commission on commodity arrangements and policies within the framework of the continuing institutional machinery which will be established following the UNCTAD. The Conference has also generally formulated terms of reference for the new commission and requested that they be given prompt and favourable consideration by the continuing institutional machinery (see Annex A.II.1).</al></li><li><al>7. The Conference has also adopted recommendations for active measures to promote market opportunities for primary commodity exports and for increases in consumption and imports in both developed and developing countries. It has expressed the belief that food aid should become an integral and continuing part of international aid under the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It has also recommended special action, both national and international, to deal with cases where natural products exported by developing countries face competition from synthetics and other substitutes. It has also recommended, <nadruk type="cur">inter alia</nadruk>,  the study and preparation of a programme of action for the organization of commodity trade (see Annexes A.II.3, A.II.4, A.II.5, A.II.6, A.II.7 and A.II.8).</al></li><li><al>8. The Conference has noted the heavy dependence of some developing countries on foreign exchange earnings from the export of minerals and fuels, and has recommended that the developed countries should effectively reduce and/or eliminate barriers and discrimination to the trade and consumption of those products, particularly internal taxation, with a view to increasing the real income of the developing countries from the said exports. It has also recommended action to provide the developing countries producing minerals and fuels with an appreciable increase in the revenues which accrue to them as a result of the export of these natural resources (see Annex A.II.9).</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">III</nr><titel status="officieel">TRADE IN MANUFACTURES AND SEMIMANUFACTURES</titel></kop><lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>9. The Conference recognizes the urgent need for the diversification and expansion of the export trade of developing countries in manufactures and semi-manufactures as a means of accelerating their economic development and raising their standards of living. It considers that individual and joint action by both developed and developing countries is necessary to enable the latter to obtain increased participation commensurate with the needs of their development in the growth of international trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured products.</al></li><li><al>10. The Conference has adopted a series of recommendations designed to help in the promotion of industries with an export potential and in the expansion of their export trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures. These recommendations deal with the following questions:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(a) Industrial development (see Annex A.III.l), dealing with the creation of a specialized agency for industrial development;</al></li><li><al>(b) Industrial branch agreements on partial division of labour (see Annex A.III.2);</al></li><li><al>(c) The establishment and expansion of industries with an export potential (see Annex A.III.3).</al></li></lijst></li><li><al>11. The Conference has recommended the adoption by governments participating in the Conference of certain guidelines in their foreign trade and assistance policies and programmes providing for increased access in the largest possible measure to markets for manufactured and semi-manufactured products of interest to developing countries, so as to enable these countries to increase and diversify their exports of these products on a stable and lasting basis. These guidelines also include appropriate provision by developing and developed countries for co-operation between governments and private groups to build up export production in developing countries (see Annexes A.III.4 and A.III.6).</al></li><li><al>12. The Conference has noted both the agreement signified by all developing countries and a great majority of the developed countries with the principle of assisting the industrial development of developing countries by the extension of preferences in their favour and the opposition to this principle expressed by some developed countries. The Conference has recommended that the Secretary-General of the United Nations establish a Committee of governmental representatives to consider the matter with a view to working out the best method of implementing such preferences on the basis of non-reciprocity from the developing countries as well as to discuss, further differences of principle involved (see Annex A.III.5).</al></li><li><al>13. The Conference has adopted a recommendation based on the readiness of the centrally planned economies to take action with a view to increasing through appropriate measures the import of manufactures and semi-manufactures from the developing countries (see Annex A.III.7).</al></li><li><al>14. The Conference has adopted a recommendation outlining practical measures for promotion of trade in manufactures and semimanufactures among developing countries (see Annex A.III.8).</al></li><li><al>15. The Conference has also adopted a recommendation calling on developed countries to take certain measures, <nadruk type="cur">inter alia</nadruk>,  on import promotion and industrial adjustment (see Annex A.III.6).</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">IV</nr><titel status="officieel">FINANCING FOR AN EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE INVISIBLE TRADE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</titel></kop><lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>16. On the main issues before the Conference on the financing of development, trade and invisible transactions, a large consensus of agreement was reached, though complete agreement was not always achieved.</al></li><li><al>17. The Conference recognizes the wide concern expressed regarding the inadequacy of the growth target of 5 per cent per annum set for the United Nations Development Decade. The Conference asknowledges the need for steps to be taken, by both developing and developed countries, to mobilize domestic and international resources for accelerated growth in developing countries at rates even higher than envisaged for the Development Decade where feasible; and that the economic situations, policies and plans of individual developing countries be examined for this purpose with the consent of the country concerned. The Conference also recognizes in this connexion that the import capacity of developing countries, resulting from the combined total of export proceeds, invisible earnings and capital inflow, and taking into account the evolution of prices, should rise sufficiently, and the measures taken by the developing countries themselves should be adequate, so as to enable these higher rates of growth to be achieved; and that all countries, developed and developing, should undertake, individually and in co-operation, such measures as may be necessary to ensure this. The Conference has also recommended that each economically advanced country should endeavour to supply, in the light of principles set forth in Annex A.IV.1, financial resources to the developing countries of a minimum net amount approaching as nearly as possible to 1 per cent of its national income, having regard, however, to the special position of certain countries which are net importers of capital (see Annex A.IV.2). The Conference has also adopted a recommendation providing, <nadruk type="cur">inter alia</nadruk>,  that the rate of interest of government loans to the developing countries should not normally exceed 3 per cent (see Annex A.IV.3).</al></li><li><al>18. The Conference has adopted recommendations concerning terms and conditions of financial and technical co-operation provided by industrialized countries through bilateral and multilateral programmes of assistance to developing countries (see Annexes A.IV.1, A.IV.3 and A.IV.4).</al></li><li><al>19. The Conference has proposed certain measures to deal with the increasing burden of accumulated debt and service payments in developing countries, with the objective of facilitating, whenever warranted and under appropriate conditions, the re-scheduling or consolidation of debts with appropriate periods of grace and amortization, and reasonable rates of interest (see Annexes A.IV.1 and A.IV.5). It has also approved the possibility of deliveries on credit of industrial equipment reimbursable in goods (see Annex A.IV.6).</al></li><li><al>20. The Conference has adopted the following recommendations proposing measures and studies concerning an increase in the volume or an improvement in the terms of financing for developing countries:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(a) Recommendations concerning a United Nations Capital Development Fund (see Annex A.IV.7), the gradual transformation of the United Nations Special Fund (see Annex A.IV.8);</al></li><li><al>(b) The provision of aid for development on a regional basis (see Annexes A.IV.9 and A.IV.10);</al></li><li><al>(c) The promotion of the flow of public and private capital both to the public and private sectors in developing countries (see Annexes A.IV.11, A.IV.12 and A.IV.13);</al></li><li><al>(d) Review of the use and terms of credit, export financing and marketing, and credit insurance (see Annexes A.IV.14, A.IV.15 and A.IV.16).</al></li></lijst></li><li><al>21. The Conference has recognized further that adverse movements in the export proceeds of developing countries can be disruptive of development. The Conference has, therefore, recommended that, as regards payments difficulties caused by temporary export shortfalls, members of the International Monetary Fund should study certain measures with a view to liberalizing the terms of the compensatory credit system operated by the Fund since February 1963 (see Annex A.IV.17). As regards longer-term problems, the Conference has recommended (see Annex A.IV.18):</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(a) That the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development be invited to study the feasibility of a scheme that would provide supplementary financial resources to developing countries experiencing shortfalls in export proceeds from reasonable expectations. The relevant economic circumstances for consideration would include the adverse effects of significant increases in import prices.</al></li><li><al>(b) That the continuing machinery recommended by this Conference be invited to study and organize further discussions of concepts and proposals for compensatory financing put forward by the delegations of developing countries at the Conference, taking into account the effect of shortfalls in export earnings and adverse movements in the terms of trade.</al></li></lijst></li><li><al>22. The Conference has also recommended a study of the international monetary issues relating to problems of trade and development with special reference to the objectives and decisions of this Conference (see Annex A.IV.19). It has also approved a recommendation on the participation of nationals of developing countries in the process of policy formulation in international financial and monetary agencies (see Annex A.IV.20).</al></li><li><al>23. The Conference has agreed on a draft text containing a common measure of understanding on shipping questions, and has recommended that appropriate inter-governmental procedures, including any committee that might be deemed necessary, be established to promote understanding and co-operation in the field of shipping, and to study and report on its economic aspects (see Annexes A.IV.21 and A.IV.22).</al></li><li><al>24. The Conference has also considered and recommended measures on insurance, tourism, technical assistance and transfer of technology, taking into account the need to improve the invisible trade of developing countries (see Annexes A.IV.23, A.IV.24, A.IV.25 and A.IV.26).</al></li></lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><label>SECTION</label><nr status="officieel">V</nr><titel status="officieel">INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS</titel></kop><lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>25.

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(a) The present United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should be established as an organ of the General Assembly to be convened at intervals of not more than three years and with a membership comprising those states which are members of the United Nations, the specialized agencies, or the I.A.E.A.</al></li><li><al>(b) The principal functions of the Conference shall be:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>(i) To promote international trade, especially with a view to accelerating economic development, particularly trade between countries at different stages of development, between developing countries and between countries with different systems of economic and social organization, taking into account the functions performed by existing international organizations;</al></li><li><al>(ii) To formulate principles and policies on international trade and related problems of economic development;</al></li><li><al>(iii) To make proposals for putting the said principles and policies into effect and to take such other steps within its competence as may be relevant to this end, having regard to differences in economic systems and stages of development;</al></li><li><al>(iv) Generally, to review and facilitate the co-ordination of activities of other institutions within the United Nations system in the field of international trade and related problems of economic development and in this regard to co-operate with the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in respect to the performance of their Charter responsibilities for co-ordination;</al></li><li><al>(v) To initiate action, where appropriate, in co-operation with the competent organs of the United Nations for the negotiation and adoption of multilateral legal instruments in the field of trade, with due regard to the adequacy of existing organs of negotiation and without duplication of their activities;</al></li><li><al>(vi) To be available as a centre for harmonizing the trade and related development policies of governments and regional economic groupings in pursuance of Article 1 of the United Nations Charter; and</al></li><li><al>(vii) To deal with any other matters within the scope of its competence.</al></li></lijst>

							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE II</tussenkop>
							<al>In territorial and on internal waters, vessels flying the flag of land-locked countries should have identical rights and enjoy treatment identical to that enjoyed by vessels flying the flag of coastal States other than the territorial State.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE III</tussenkop>
							<al>In order to enjoy the freedom of the seas on equal terms with coastal States, States having no sea coast should have free access to the sea. To this end States situated between the sea and a State having no sea coast shall by common agreement with the latter and in conformity with existing international conventions accord to ships flying the flag of that State treatment equal to that accorded to their own ships or to the ships of any other State as regards access to sea ports and the use of such ports.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE IV</tussenkop>
							<al>In order to promote fully the economic development of the land-locked countries, the said countries should be afforded by all States, on the basis of reciprocity, free and unrestricted transit, in such a manner that they have free access to regional and international trade in all circumstances and for every type of goods.</al>
							<al>Goods in transit should not be subject to any customs duty.</al>
							<al>Means of transport in transit should not be subject to special taxes or charges higher than those levied for the use of means of transport of the transit country.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE V</tussenkop>
							<al>The State of transit, while maintaining full sovereignty over its territory, shall have the right to take all indispensable measures to ensure that the exercise of the right of free and unrestricted transit shall in no way infringe its legitimate interests of any kind.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE VI</tussenkop>
							<al>In order to accelerate the evolution of a universal approach to the solution of the special and particular problems of trade and development of land-locked countries in the different geographical areas, the conclusion of regional and other international agreements in this regard should be encouraged by all States.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE VII</tussenkop>
							<al>The facilities and special rights accorded to land-locked countries in view of their special geographical position are excluded from the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">PRINCIPLE VIII</tussenkop>
							<al>The principles which govern the right of free access to the sea of the land-locked State shall in no way abrogate existing agreements between two or more contracting parties concerning the problems, nor shall they raise an obstacle as regards the conclusion of such agreements in the future, provided that the latter do not establish a r&#xE9;gime which is less favourable than or opposed to the above-mentioned provisions.</al>

Commodity arrangements may, however, also cover groups of commodities under certain circumstances. Where the negotiation of arrangements for a group of commodities is considered desirable but does not appear practicable, the possibility of negotiating simultaneously a number of separate arrangements for different commodities can be considered.

							</al></li><li><al>(viii) Giving special attention in study groups or in the negotiation and operation of international commodity agreements to the need for measures to mitigate short-term fluctuations in the prices of the natural products facing competition from synthetics;</al></li><li><al>(ix) Bringing about as much co-ordination as possible in investment planning and policies in the field of the natural and synthetic sectors;</al></li><li><al>(x) Introducing where appropriate financial measures with a view to reducing the impact of the development of synthetics on the long-term prospects for the export earnings of developing countries and to assist them in undertaking the necessary structural adjustments;</al></li><li><al>(xi) Where feasible and necessary, and taking account of the studies recommended in 4 (c), adopt mixing regulations or comparable actions in order to ensure that the proportion of utilization of natural products is not reduced.</al></li></lijst></li><li><al>2. <nadruk type="cur">The Conference recommends</nadruk>  that countries, particularly developed countries, should avoid giving special encouragement to the production of new synthetics which may displace other natural products and to additional investment in the production of synthetic materials competing with the natural products exported by the developing countries, especially when such investment can be employed more effectively in other fields; and, in exceptional cases requiring a departure from this principle, consultations be held with the developing countries likely to be adversely affected, or with the appropriate international bodies, in order to consider forms of co-operation, including financial measures, to mitigate such adverse effects.</al></li><li><al>3. Stressing the need to keep under continuing scrutiny the problem resulting from the development of synthetic substitutes, <nadruk type="cur">the Conference recommends</nadruk>  that consideration be given by appropriate bodies within the United Nations family, especially those bodies which might be created following the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to the establishment of a permanent sub-group to deal with the problems of commodities affected by competition from synthetic substitutes and other substitute products. The sub-group should give consideration to studies being carried out in this field, and in the meantime these studies should be vigorously pursued.</al></li><li><al>4. <nadruk type="cur">The Conference recommends</nadruk>  that studies be made on the following points:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">a.</nadruk>  Feasibility of agreements covering both the natural product and its synthetic substitutes;</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">b.</nadruk>  Possible role of long-term contracts (up to 10 years) in stabilizing the market for particular natural products; consideration of new techniques for extending the scope and applicability of such contracts;</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">c.</nadruk>  Feasibility of mixing regulations.</al></li></lijst></li></lijst>

							<al>the <nadruk type="cur">Conference recommends</nadruk>, amongst practical measures which could be taken
with these ends in view, a new type of international co-operation in the form of
industrial branch agreements between the countries concerned based on partial
division of labour aimed at promoting the existing and establishing new export industries
in the developing countries.</al></li><li><al>II. In the case of the industrial branch agreements between developing countries
and centrally planned economies, the principal features of such agreements may be
described as follows:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>1. <nadruk type="cur">Long-term bilateral or multilateral agreements.</nadruk>  The agreements, because of
their very nature, will have to be concluded on a long-term basis. They may be
either of bilateral or multilateral character. The latter form would apply to cases
where the machinery and equipment for the establishment and development of a
particular export industry would be supplied by two or more countries with centrally-planned economies, and/or the export industry in question would be jointly
established by two or more developing countries, and/or where the products of the
particular industry could be sold to two or more countries with centrally-planned
economies.</al></li><li><al>2. <nadruk type="cur">Partners to agreements.</nadruk>  The agreement would be concluded between the
governments or trading organizations and production enterprises in countries with
centrally planned economies, and the governments or public and private corporations
in the developing countries.</al></li><li><al>3. <nadruk type="cur">Selection of export industries.</nadruk>  Resource-based industries and/or industries
producing manufactures of higher levels of processing may be established for which:
(a) the developing country has a suitable raw material base or other suitable conditions
for the development of the industry and a limited domestic demand for its
products; and (b) the country with the centrally planned economy has the capacity
of exporting the required machinery and equipment and associated technical assistance
for their installation and operation and is prepared to adapt its development
plans so as to import a stated proportion of the output of these industries.</al></li><li><al>4. <nadruk type="cur">Credit.</nadruk>  The country with the centrally planned economy will provide machinery
and equipment to the developing countries on credit at reasonable terms and
rates of interest.</al></li><li><al>5. <nadruk type="cur">Repayment of credit.</nadruk>  The repayment of the credit in instalments will be
agreed upon between the contracting parties. It might be made by the developing
countries fully or in part by: (a) exports of raw materials and other commodities
until the export industry has production available for export; and (b) an agreed
proportion of the output of the export industry and other specified commodities in
the subsequent period until the credit is fully repaid.</al></li><li><al>6. <nadruk type="cur">Co-operation in design and research.</nadruk>  The agreement will include provisions
tor close co-operation between the respective partners in designing the product, and
research for improving the processes of production and the quality of products.</al></li><li><al>7. <nadruk type="cur">Clearance of payments.</nadruk>  As a rule the branch agreements will be linked to
trade agreements and payments arrangements between the countries concerned. The
latter should provide, to the maximum extent possible, for multilateral clearance.</al></li><li><al>8. <nadruk type="cur">Prices.</nadruk>  Prices of machinery and equipment and technical services provided
by the countries with centrally-planned economies and those of goods exported by
the developing countries will be agreed upon in the light of world prices and world
standards.</al></li><li><al>9. If required by the developing countries, countries with centrally-planned
economies may assist in promoting the exports of products of the new industries
to third countries. The agreement may also contain provisions dealing with reexports
of the products of the new industries and other commodities.</al></li><li><al>10. The establishment of the export industries in the developing countries under
the branch agreements is designed to create complementarity of economies based
on specialization and partial division of labour. The exports of these industries to
countries with centrally planned economies would be expected, therefore, to continue
after the credit for the machinery and equipment has been fully repaid.</al></li><li><al>11. The negotiations concerning the conclusion of branch agreements may best
be initiated through bilateral consultations. Such consultations would take place as a rule between governments; appropriate governmental institutions such as
development banks; trade associations and similar bodies having sufficient general
knowledge of the economies of the countries concerned. When trade co-operation
between the countries has already sufficiently developed, the establishment of specific
branch committees with representatives of both sides may be envisaged which
would deal with the implementation of the agreements and other relevant matters
as they arise.</al></li></lijst></li></lijst>

on Trade and Development to adopt the following guide lines in their foreign trade
and assistance policies and programmes affecting trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured
products of export interest to developing countries;</al></li></lijst><tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">
TARIFF AND NON-TARIFF BARRIERS</tussenkop>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>9. Developed countries should not ordinarily raise existing tariff or non-tariff
barriers to exports from developing countries nor establish new tariff or non-tariff barriers or any discriminatory measures, where such action would have the effect
of rendering less favourable the conditions of access into their markets of manufactured
and semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries.
If in exceptional and compelling circumstances a developed country imposes of intensifies
quantitative restrictions or increases tariffs on imports of manufactured or
semi-manufactured products of export interest to developing countries it should
consult, upon their request, the developing countries affected, bilaterally or in appropriate
international institutions;</al></li><li><al>10. Developed countries should accord high priority in international trade negotiations
to according maximum reductions in and, wherever possible, elimination of
duties on manufactured and semi-manufactured products of export interest to
developing countries. In these negotiations every effort should be made to secure
maximum reductions in and, wherever possible, the elimination of tariff differentials
which differentiate unreasonably between such products in their primary and
their processed forms. The benefits of the negotiations should not be limited to
countries which are members of the international organization under whose aegis
the negotiations take place;</al></li><li><al>11. Developed countries should, as a matter of urgency, remove quantitative
restrictions on manufactured and semi-manufactured products of export interest
to developing countries as soon as possible;</al></li><li><al>12. Developed countries, in co-operation with a competent international body,
should proceed forthwith to identify existing non-tariff barriers to expanded trade
in manufactured and semi-manufactured products of current or evident potential
export interest to developing countries and should, as a matter of urgency, seek
practical approaches to the maximum feasible reduction or the elimination of such
barriers at an early date;</al></li><li><al>13. Appropriate provision should be made by developing and developed countries
to encourage co-operation between governments and private groups in their
countries so as to build up export production in developing countries of manufactures
and semi-manufactures in demand by consumers and industrial users in
advanced countries. Co-operative measures should be taken to raise the level of
technology and of industrial skills in the developing countries;</al></li><li><al>14. Developed countries should participate, through the appropriate international
trade body, in analyzing the development plans and policies of individual developing
countries, at their request, and in examining trade and relationships with a
view to devising concrete measures to promote the development of export potential
and to facilitate access to export markets for the products of the industries thus
developed. In this connexion they should seek appropriate collaboration with
governments and international organizations having competence in relation to financial
assistance for economic development, in systematic studies of trade and aid
relationships in individual developing countries aimed at obtaining a clear analysis
of export potential, market prospects and any further action that may be required;</al></li><li><al>15. Developed and developing countries should collaborate in seeking methods
to expand export trade of developing countries through international harmonization
and adjustment of national policies and regulations, through technical and
commercial standards affecting production, transportation and marketing, and
through export promotion by the establishment of facilities, within individual countries
or competent international organs, for the increased flow of trade information
and the development of market research;</al></li><li><al>16. When measures recommended above are insufficient to give rise to a steady
and effective flow to the developed countries of processed, semi-manufactured and
manufactured products from developing countries in the initial phases of industrialization,
developed and developing countries should examine, through and with the
appropriate international institutions, what additional and, if necessary, new ways
and means can be provided to support the national development and export programmes
of the least industrialized countries. In this respect, consideration should
be given inter alia to channelling financial and technical assistance through appropriate
international organizations, including regional economic organizations in
cases where the developing countries needing such assistance are participating in
regional economic programmes;</al></li><li><al>17. In relation to the foregoing, periodic discussions and consultations should
be held by developed and developing countries in appropriate international institutions
for the purpose of:</al>

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>1. Some part of repayment of loans may be accepted in national currencies of the debtor countries, either through bilateral or regional arrangements, through payments' unions, credit insurance arrangements or other appropriate measures;</al></li><li><al>2. Repayments should be spread over a considerably long period which should normally be not less than twenty years, and with a certain grace period, taking into account the specific nature of goods. Existing loans should, where necessary, be mutually re-studied and revised with a view to consolidation and re-negotiation, where the economic condition of a recipient country so justifies it;</al></li><li><al>3. As far as possible, aid should be a blend of grant and loans. Interest rates for development loans should take into account the repayment capacity of the borrowing country. Endeavour should be made that they should not normally exceed 3 per cent and, where this is not feasible, waivers of interest should be considered to meet this objective. In cases where necessary and justified, wherever they are in excess of this figure, they should be re-negotiated to bring them down to a reasonable level.</al></li><li><al>4. Inasmuch as aid and trade should be co-ordinated, and where loans are repayable in convertible currencies and are tied to purchases in donor countries, ways and means should be devised both in centrally planned economies, where some such arrangements already exist, and in free market economies, for the repayment of such loans in mutually determined commodities and manufactures produced by the debtor country. For this purpose, it is suggested that an expert group of industrialized and developing countries should be constituted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to work out the mechanism of such procedures or devise means to mitigate the difficulties of developing countries in this regard. Arrangements for deliveries on credit of capital equipment on conditions of repayment from resultant production or through goods produced by recipient countries could also be considered in appropriate cases and under suitable conditions;</al></li></lijst>

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>5. As far as possible, development loans should not be tied to particular projects and, where this becomes unavoidable, for reasons of over-all managerial and technical assistance or bilateral association in some specific cases or due to special credit terms or acute balance-of-payment difficulties in donor countries, necessary care should be taken that loans for infra-structure and social schemes such as education, public health and community development should nonetheless be of a particularly soft nature;</al></li><li><al>6. Loans for purchase of capital equipment or non-project assistance should not ordinarily be tied to purchases in donor countries and, keeping in view the desirability of flexibility to developing countries in their procurement policies, should be available for use in best markets and particularly in the markets of recipient and other developing countries. In any case, they should be available for purchases in countries with convertible currencies. Moreover, in all cases of tied loans, where the recipient country can show that the required equipment and goods are available at cheaper rates or better terms elsewhere, either the governments should intervene to bring down prices and regulate conditions of supply or, where this is not feasible, to transfer the funds for other purchases in donor countries at competitive rates or, failing that, to release them for free purchase in the best market from the point of view of the recipient country;</al></li><li><al>7. Where development loans are unavoidably tied to projects, regard should be had to the fact that some developing countries are not always able to provide the counterpart local currency requirements for implementation of a project and that a number of projects give rise to additional indirect foreign exchange requirements. In such cases, the loans should be devised directly or indirectly to cover substantially more than the foreign exchange component of the project;</al></li></lijst>

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in the light of its experience in relation to countries for which there are consortia and consultative groups, or other appropriate bodies under the aegis of the United Nations, should be encouraged, at the request of developing countries concerned, and where appropriate, to co-ordinate aid in respect of individual countries or groups of countries through consortia or regional or other suitable institutions where they exist.

To ensure better co-ordination between trade and aid, it is recommended that governments of both aid-giving and aid-receiving countries should have at their disposal adequate co-ordination machinery for arriving at mutually consistent and constructive decisions and adequate information on which to base policy decisions concerning the issues. For this purpose, studies and surveys evaluating progress in adapting aid to trade needs should be periodically made;</al></li><li><al>13.

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>1. It was agreed that the liner conference system is necessary in order to secure
stable rates and regular services. However, in order that the system may function
properly it is necessary that there should be close co-operation between shippers
and the conferences. As an initial step a well organized consultation machinery should be established with adequate procedures for hearing and remedying complaints
by the formation of shippers' councils or other suitable bodies on a national
and regional basis. It was noted that action has already been taken in some countries
on these lines and that the experience thus gained would offer a useful model
for other countries to consider. The following matters which may need consideration
could be raised within such machinery:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">a.</nadruk>  Publication by Conferences of their tariffs and regulations.</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">b.</nadruk>  Increases in conference freight rates, levy of surcharges, etc., giving of
reasonable advance notice in this regard.</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">c.</nadruk>  The terms of dual rate and deferred rebate agreements.</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">d.</nadruk>  Effective representation of conferences in major ports of developing countries
where appropriate.</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">e.</nadruk>  The adequacy of shipping services in the trades concerned.</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">f.</nadruk>  Action to be undertaken in order to improve and promote exports of developing
countries and in particular intra-regional trade.</al></li><li><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">g.</nadruk>  Rationalization of routes and freights, established or to be established in accordance
with the national characteristics of production, marketing and development
requirements.</al></li></lijst></li><li><al>2. The costs of inland transportation and the cargo handling costs in ports (including
the cost of ships' time spent in port) in many cases represent a substantial
percentage of total transportation costs of international shipments. There are possibilities
of reducing the total cost of transportation by improving port facilities and
in the establishment of new facilities. All countries should therefore give priority
to improvement of port operation and of connected inland transportation facilities.
Greater efforts should be made in providing for the aforesaid purposes and to this
end international financing and aid and technical assistance be made available on
favourable terms and conditions.</al></li><li><al>3. It was considered that the development of merchant marines in developing
countries as well as their participation in liner conferences as full members on
equitable terms is to be welcomed. The question of development of merchant marines
by developing countries should be decided by such countries on the basis of
sound economic criteria.</al></li><li><al>4. While accepting the above common measure of understanding, the sponsor

They regard this Conference as the fruition of sustained efforts which found expression in the Cairo Declaration, the Alta Gracia Charter, the Resolutions of Brazilia, Addis Ababa, Niamey, Manilla and Teheran and, above all, in the Joint Declaration of the seventy-five countries made at the eighteenth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. These efforts helped to forge the unity of the seventy-five - the outstanding feature of the entire Conference and an event of historic significance.</al></li></lijst>

The basic premises of the new order were enumerated in these earlier declarations and in the report of the Secretary-General of the Conference. In brief, they involve a new international division of labour oriented towards the accelerated industrialization of developing countries. The efforts of developing countries to raise the living standards of their peoples, which are now being made under adverse external conditions, should be supplemented and strengthened by constructive international action. Such action should establish a new framework of international trade that is wholly consistent with the needs of accelerated development.</al></li><li><al>3. The several themes of a new and dynamic international policy for trade and development, including the question of transit trade of land-locked countries, found concrete expression in specific programmes and proposals presented by the developing countries to this Conference as a united expression of objectives and measures in all major fields. The developing countries consider it an achievement that this Conference has provided a basis for the fullest discussion of these programmes and proposals by the entire international community. They are confident that the deliberations of this Conference will be of assistance in the formulation of new policies by the Governments of both developed and developing countries in the context of a new awareness of the needs of developing countries.</al></li></lijst>

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>4. The developing countries declare, however, that they consider the final recommendations of the Conference as only an initial step towards an international endorsement of a new trade policy for development. They do not consider that the progress that has been registered in each of the major fields of economic development has been adequate or commensurate with their essential requirements. There has not, for instance, been an adequate appreciation of the problem of the 'trade gap' of developing countries. Only the most limited approaches were made regarding trade in primary commodities, and of preferences for exports of manufactures. Similarly, only preliminary steps were possible relating to schemes for compensatory financing to meet long-term deterioration in the terms of trade. The developing countries have, nevertheless, accepted the results of this Conference in the hope that these results would lay the foundation for more substantial progress in the period ahead. They have also accepted these resolutions in recognition of the need for a co-operative effort in the international field. To this end they have chosen to arrive at the widest measure of agreements possible, rather than to register their aspirations by majority decisions.</al></li></lijst>

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>5. The developing countries attach singular importance to the establishment of international machinery in the field of trade and development. It is vitally necessary that this new machinery should be an effective instrument for the discussion of issues, the formulation of policies, the review of results and for taking such operational measures as are needed in the sphere of international economic relations.</al></li><li><al>6. The developing countries recognize the value of the general agreement attained regarding the establishment of continuing machinery. They note that some important issues pertaining to such machinery have been held over for decision by the General Assembly. In this connexion it is their view that there should be ample scope for reaching workable agreement on substantial issues. But they categorically declare that no arrangements designed for this purpose should derogate from the ultimate right of the proposed Board and the Conference to adopt recommendations on any point of substance by a simple majority vote in the case of the Board and two-thirds majority vote in the case of the Conference. The developing countries attach cardinal importance to democratic procedures which afford no position of privilege in the economic and financial, no less than in the political sphere. Furthermore, the developing countries would stress the need for continued evolution in the institutional field leading not merely to the progressive strengthening of the machinery that is now contemplated, but also to the ultimate emergence of a comprehensive international trade organization.</al></li></lijst>

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>7. The developing countries regard their own unity, the unity of the seventy-five, as the outstanding feature of this Conference. This unity has sprung out of the fact that facing the basic problems of development they have a common interest in a new policy for international trade and development. They believe that it is this unity that has given clarity and coherence to the discussions of this Conference. Their solidarity has been tested in the course of the Conference and they have emerged from it with even greater unity and strength.</al></li><li><al>8. The developing countries have a strong conviction that there is a vital need to maintain and further strengthen this unity in the years ahead. It is an indispensable instrument for securing the adoption of new attitudes and new approaches in the international economic field. This unity is also an instrument for enlarging the area of co-operative endeavour in the international field and for securing mutually beneficient relationships with the rest of the world. Finally, it is a necessary means for co-operation amongst the developing countries themselves.</al></li><li><al>9. The seventy-five developing countries, on the occasion of this declaration, pledge themselves to maintain, foster and strengthen this unity in the future. Towards this end they shall adopt all possible means to increase the contacts and consultations amongst themselves so as to determine common objectives and formulate joint programmes of action in international economic co-operation. They consider that measures for consolidating the unity achieved by the seventy-five countries during the Conference and the specific arrangements for contacts and consultations should be studied by Government representatives during the Nineteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.</al></li></lijst>

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development marks the beginning of a new era in the evolution of international co-operation in the field of trade and development. Such co-operation must serve as a decisive instrument for ending the division of the world into areas of affluence and intolerable poverty. This task is the outstanding challenge of our times. The injustice and neglect of centuries need to be redressed. The developing countries are united in their resolve to continue the quest for such redress and look to the entire international community for understanding and support in this endeavour.</al></li></lijst>

							<al>RESERVATIONS OF THE DELEGATIONS OF THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES WHICH SUBMITTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL TRADE ORGANIZATION<noot type="voet"><noot.nr>1</noot.nr><noot.al> E/CONF.46/50 and Rev.1.</noot.al></noot>, OR WHICH SUPPORT THE IDEA OF SUCH AN ORGANIZATION, AS SET FORTH IN THE STATEMENT BY THE CZECHOSLOVAK DELEGATION AT THE PLENARY MEETING ON 15 JUNE 1964</al>
							<al>In connexion with the adoption by the Conference of the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 on institutional arrangements, the delegations of the socialist countries, which submitted the proposal for, and support the idea of, the speedy establishment of a universal international trade organization deem it necessary to present the following observations.</al>
							<al>Paragraphs 1, 30 and 31 of the above-mentioned Recommendation do not reflect the substance of the proposals and statements made during the discussion of institutional arrangements at the Conference. The discussion of this matter showed that the majority of those participating in the Conference clearly favoured the speedy establishment of a universal international trade organization as an instrument designed to ensure the necessary development of international trade in the interests of all countries and especially the developing countries.</al>
							<al>The proposal for the establishment of an international trade organization is set forth, in particular, in documents E/CONF.46/50 and Rev.1, E/CONF.46/C. 4/L.3 and E/CONF.46/C.4/L.5, and in the Fourth Committee recommendation (E/CONF.46/C.4/L.12/Rev.1) which was adopted by a very large majority of the Committee.</al>
							<al>The above countries are still firmly of the opinion that it is absolutely essential to carry out the proposal for the establishment of a universal international trade organization, which would be truly capable of promoting the removal of various kinds of obstacles and discrimination in international trade. In particular, the socialist countries, now as before, consider that a universal international trade organization and the provisional body set up for a transitional period should concern themselves with all the problems of international trade, including, in particular, the promotion of east-west trade and the removal of obstacles to such trade.</al>
							<al>If the organization is to be in a position to carry out these important tasks, it must be open to all countries participating in world trade and wishing to contribute to the success of the organization.</al>
							<al>Most delegations attending the Conference are fully aware that not one of the existing international institutions is able or fitted to handle all the problems of trade and development.</al>
							<al>It is imperative to overcome the present organizational confusion and correct the existing unsatisfactory international trade situation, thereby promoting the aims and purposes of the United Nations Charter in this sphere.</al>
							
							<al>In the course of the Conference, the socialist countries have sought the closest and most comprehensive co-operation with other countries, especially the developing countries as a whole. They have co-operated with the developing countries in the preparation of specific proposals on a number of questions, including, in particular, institutional questions. They agreed with them to vote for the last draft proposals on institutional arrangements (E/CONF.46/C.4/L.12/Rev.1) and gave that draft priority in the order of voting. The result was that, by an overwhelming majority, the Fourth Committee of the Conference adopted a satisfactory decision on institutional arrangements. That decision, however, was modified by the action of western countries which did not agree with it. A text considerably weaker in practical content was consequently placed before the Conference.</al>
							<al>Many countries will, we feel, regret that the more satisfactory text of the Fourth Committee was not adopted in plenary session.</al>
							<al>Nevertheless, desiring to see the Conference end in unanimity and agreement, the socialist countries decided not to oppose document E/CONF.46/L.22 (subsequently adopted as Recommendation A.V.1), although aware of its weakness. We are convinced that all countries will realize the need of truly radical measures for the normalization of international trade and the speedy establishment of a universal international trade organization to that end.</al>
							<al>We shall continue to work for the speedy accomplishment of this purpose.</al>

							<al>In recognizing the great needs of the developing countries to increase their earnings from exports of primary commodities, the delegation of Finland wishes to state that, because of financial reasons and conditions prevailing in agriculture in Finland, the possibilities of the Finnish Government to implement the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1, especially in respect of Part II, &#x201C;Actions recommended to be taken by developed market economy nations&#x201D;, are limited.</al>

							<al>The French delegation observes that the Final Act contains certain declarations and recommendations on which it was obliged to state its position when votes were taken in committee or in plenary meeting. Consequently the approval given by the French delegation to the Final Act should be interpreted in the light of the observations or reservations which it expressed concerning those recommendations, and in the light of those expressed on behalf of the six States members of the European Economic Community by the representative of Belgium when he stated that he was speaking as the spokesman of those six States.</al>

							<al>It also abstained on Special Principles Five, Six, Seven, Eleven, Twelve.</al>

							<al>The French delegation reserves its position on paragraph 1 (vii) and 2 of the recommendation in Annex A.II.7 (Competition from synthetics and substitutes) and therefore cannot support their implementation.</al>
							<al>It considers that:</al>
							<al>
								<nadruk type="cur">With respect to paragraph 1 (vii):</nadruk>  this includes certain provisions referring to &#x201C;access to markets&#x201D; which might, if applied, conflict with the application of provisions of the Treaty of Rome and of Community policies flowing from that Treaty.</al><al>

							<al>Some developing countries impose taxes on certain raw materials when exported, or hinder their clearance, whereas at the same time their exports of products manufactured with these raw materials are exempt from duty or benefit by various direct or indirect advantages.</al>
							<al>There is the danger that such practices may seriously disturb industries processing these raw materials in other countries.</al>

							<al>Recognizing the need for closer economic co-operation between the developing countries, the French delegation has decided in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8.</al>
							<al>Nevertheless; it considers that if, in application of the provisions of paragraphs III (e), IV (a) (v) and IV (b), all the developing countries granted from the beginning tariff or other preferences to each other, establishment of the regional economic groupings, which represents the most effective form of co-operation, would be hindered thereby.</al>

							<al>Further, the French delegation requests that the text, annexed hereto, of the reservations and observations relating to the seventeen Recommendations of the Third Committee be reproduced at the appropriate place in the Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</al>
							<al>This communication refers only to the reservations formulated in connexion with the votes on the Recommendations submitted by the Third Committee. Other communications will be submitted on the other votes in the Plenary Assembly.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.1</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation, without questioning the importance of the principle laid down in paragraph 1 (d), points out that its acceptance cannot be interpreted as a general commitment which would limit its freedom of choice with respect to the application of its aid policy. It wishes further to make clear that its acceptance of paragraph 1 (g) should not be interpreted as a commitment on its part.</al>
							<al>As regards paragraphs 1 (b) and 2, reference should be made to the observations on the Recommendations in Annexes A.IV. 18 and A.IV.5.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annexes A.IV.3 and A.IV.4</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation abstained from voting on these two Recommendations, as it has serious reservations with respect to the second part of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.3 and paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 11 of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.4.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.25</tussenkop>
							<al>Although in agreement with a large number of the ideas contained in this Recommendation, the French delegation cannot vote for it because of the rigid nature of certain of the measures for which it makes provision.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.11</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation draws attention to the fact that capital borrowed on international markets, guaranteed by the international community, and re-lent at very low rates of interest made possible by an interest equalization fund, is definitely of the nature of public resources rather than private capital; hence, while it considers studies in this field to be useful, it doubts that the use of such methods will permit an effective increase in the volume of financial assistance.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.9</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation considers that the establishment of new development funds would serve no useful purpose and would even be harmful. The functions in view can be carried out satisfactorily by existing general or regional bodies. There is no ground for the belief that the establishment of new bodies would bring about an increase in the total volume of assistance; on the contrary, they would serve to increase costs and to dissipate resources and efforts.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.10</tussenkop>
							<al>As the Recommendation was adopted without a vote, the French delegation had no opportunity to state that it wished to abstain from the vote on the first operative paragraph in order not to restrict its freedom of action in carrying out its assistance policy.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.12</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation would point out that the list, in paragraph A.1, of some of the measures likely to stimulate the flow of private investment capital cannot be regarded as exhaustive; it expresses a reservation regarding the second part of this paragraph (&#x201C;such as ... developing countries&#x201D;).</al>
							<al>In addition, the French delegation considers that the &#x201C;appropriate steps&#x201D; referred to in paragraph B.3 (first sentence) should include, in particular, the conclusion of international agreements with a view to improving the conditions for private investment.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annexes A.IV.7 and A.IV.8</tussenkop>
							<al>In voting against the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.7 and in abstaining from the vote on the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.8, the French delegation wished to recall that it was opposed to any extension of the activities of the Special Fund to the field of investment because other specialized agencies of the United Nations are responsible for that field and such an extension might jeopardize the effective action of the Special Fund in the pre-investment sector.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.5</tussenkop>
							<al>In abstaining from the vote on this Recommendation the French delegation wished to indicate that any procedure which was too general or too systematic in rature to permit re-scheduling of the external debt might have results contrary to the objectives sought. Such arrangements can only be considered case by case and by agreement between the debtor country and its creditors, and in liaison, if necessary, with the international institutions concerned.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.14</tussenkop>
							<al>While approving the principle of a study of these questions, the French delegation expresses serious reservations concerning the content of the document annexed to the Recommendation.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.15</tussenkop>
							<al>In abstaining on this text, the French delegation wished to indicate that it did not contemplate participating in the financing of such a fund if established.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.18</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation has not, by its vote in favour of this Recommendation accepted the principle of any scheme for the long-term compensation of fluctuations in export earnings; in its opinion, the real solution lies in the organization of primary produce markets, permitting the maintenance of stable and remunerative prices.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.17</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation recalls that it would be premature to reach a final decision on a system which has been in existence for only one year and which has so far been put to very little use; the modifications described by the text should therefore be examined in the light of experience, when more substantial experience has been acquired. Further, their compatibility with the liquidity of the International Monetary Fund should be studied.</al>
							<al>Moreover, the French delegation expressed the same reservations with respect to operative paragraph 3 as in the case of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.18</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.24</tussenkop>
							<al>Although it voted in favour of the text, the French delegation has serious reservations to make with respect to paragraph 17 of this Recommendation.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Annex A.IV.26</tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation considers that the conclusions of international agreements on this subjects would be undesirable.</al>
							<tussenkop kopopmaak="cur"><nadruk type="cur">Observations on the Recommendation in Annex A.V.I (Institutional arrangements methods and machinery to implement measures relating to the expansion of international trade)</nadruk></tussenkop>
							<al>The French delegation voted for the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1. Nevertheless, it finds the drafting of paragraph 25 unnecessarily complicated. It would have preferred a simpler wording, which would not have prejudged in any way the direction in which solutions to the difficulties in question should be sought, or the manner in which a problem should be settled before any steps had even been taken to study it.</al>
							<al>The French delegation observes that the provisions for implementing certain recommendations make explicit reference to institutional machinery which still has to be established. The French delegation must therefore reserve its position with respect to these recommendations until this machinery has been established by the United Nations General Assembly and it can form a final judgment thereon.</al>

							<al>
								<nadruk type="cur">First,</nadruk>  the principle of the gradual phasing-out of existing preferential arrangements between developed and developing countries which involve discrimination against other developing countries should be applied <nadruk type="cur">generally</nadruk>  and not restricted solely to arrangements between developed and developing countries.

								<nadruk type="cur">Second,</nadruk>  the &#x201C;international measures providing at least equivalent advantages&#x201D; for the developing countries affected by the gradual phasing-out of preferential arrangements should consist not only of satisfactory financial compensation, but must also include other measures to offset the social and economic repercussions resulting from the loss of preferential arrangements. There would have to be the clear understanding that such international measures would include <nadruk type="cur">inter alia</nadruk>  extension of general preferences by <nadruk type="cur">all</nadruk>  developed countries in favour of all developing countries.</al><al>
								<nadruk type="cur">Third,</nadruk>  preferential arrangements between developed and developing countries essential for the maintenance and growth of the export earnings of the developing countries which are based on contractual obligations between developing and developed countries can be phased out only by mutual agreement between the developed and developing countries concerned.</al><al>

							<al>The recommendations of the Conference generally divide all countries into only two categories, namely, developing countries and developed countries.</al>
							<al>These recommendations do not take account of countries which, while sharing some of the problems of &#x201C;developing&#x201D; countries, neither need nor seek accommodation to the extent and depth required by the &#x201C;developing&#x201D; countries and, while also sharing some common features with &#x201C;developed&#x201D; countries cannot agree, because of their own development needs, to inequitable treatment adversely affecting their own trade and development and cannot accept all the obligations formulated for acceptance by &#x201C;developed&#x201D; countries.</al>
							<al>South Africa is such a country which is clearly neither a &#x201C;developed&#x201D; nor a &#x201C;developing&#x201D; country, in the context of the deliberations of the Conference and the sense in which these terms are used in this Final Act.</al>
							<al>The Government of South Africa fully recognizes the urgent need for the accelerated development of developing countries and the role which the implementation of recommendations for the expansion of international trade can play in the promotion of such development.</al>
							<al>In the circumstances, the Government of South Africa will take note of the recommendations of the Conference and will consider, with due regard to South Africa's own development needs, policies and special economic conditions, implementing the recommendations adopted by the Conference. To this end, the Government of South Africa will co-operate with all other Governments desiring such co-operation to lay the foundations of a better world economic order.</al>

							<al>The Swiss delegation has approved the Recommendation in Annex A.II.1, subject to the following remarks:</al>
							<al>Switzerland's liberal import policy has already had substantial results for exporters in the developing countries. Most of the country's food requirements are met by unprocessed, processed or semi-processed agricultural products imported from countries in tropical or temperate zones. Import duties in particular are moderate, and experience has shown that they have never had an adverse affect on the consumption of these products.</al>
							<al>In general, duties and taxes levied on imported commodities form part of the State revenue, and the State must be careful not to reduce them without good reason.</al>
							<al>Further, owing to the special conditions existing in the country, Switzerland is obliged to apply price support measures for its key agricultural products.</al>
							<al>While aiming to maintain the <nadruk type="cur">status quo</nadruk>  and to take further steps when this appears necessary and possible to increase the consumption of agricultural products and foodstuffs in general, the Swiss authorities will have to continue adjusting these price support measures to agricultural policy requirements in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Swiss constitution and legislative provisions. Subject to the same conditions, they will support efforts to conclude satisfactory international agreements on commodities.</al>
							<al>These observations also apply to the other recommendations (including principles) adopted by the Conference, in so far as they refer to similar questions.</al>

							<al>Switzerland believes that the granting of preferences to developing countries by developed countries would expose the international trading system to risks which are out of proportion to the limited and precarious advantages which preferences might offer in certain cases. It is consequently opposed to preferences of this kind, but it is in favour of special advantages for the developing countries which - without infringing the most-favoured-nation clause - would effectively encourage the growth and diversification of their exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures to industrialized countries.</al>

							<al>The Swiss delegation approved the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8. It wishes to specify, however, that in its view the preferences which developing countries may grant one another (sections III(e) and IV(b) of the recommendation) should be designed to promote an expansion of the markets of those countries and thereby widen the basis of their industrial production.</al>

							<al>In connexion with those two Recommendations, it points out that the Swiss Government has no power to compel private industries to communicate technical information or to grant patents or licences to foreign countries. Such transfers are, however, a common practice.</al>
							<al>The Swiss delegation interprets paragraph 2 of the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.26 as meaning that developing countries which adopt appropriate legislative and administrative measures in the field of industrial technology will do so with a view to promoting and facilitating the transfer of technical knowledge without interfering with intellectual property rights.</al>

It was, however, compelled to abstain from voting on this text, because the wording differs from that approved by the United Nations General Assembly.</al>

							<al>The delegation voted for this Recommendation.</al>
							<al>The attitude of the delegation to international commodity arrangements has already been set out in the draft recommendation they presented, and in the First Committee's summary records and report. With regard to Part I of this Recommendation, the United Kingdom view remains that prices in commodity arrangements can be determined only in relation to the circumstances of the commodity concerned.</al>
							<al>On Section D of Part I of this Recommendation, the delegation agree that consideration should be given to the establishment of a Commission on International Commodity Arrangements and Policies. However, it has been recognized that there was no opportunity for a substantive discussion of the proposals in Section D, either in the First or the Fourth Committees. Accordingly, it is the opinion of the delegation that the details of Section D remain to be considered. Some of these are unlikely to be acceptable to the United Kingdom and the delegation must therefore maintain their position until substantive discussions have taken place, particularly in regard to the proposed executive functions of the Commission and its relationship with other international bodies in this field.</al>

The delegation must, however, emphasize the importance which they attach to the statement in the preamble to the Recommendation, that the characteristics of insurance and reinsurance activities, in general, require operation on an international basis. In their view insurance and reinsurance business should be free from any restrictions controls which are not in the interests of policy holders.

							<al>The United States has voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.5 concerning promotion of trade between developing countries because it considers that the subject is an important one and that the resolution as a whole is appropriately addressed to the problem. It is opposed, however, to the provisions of subparagraphs (e) and (k), since they provide a blanket endorsement of regional payments unions and such forms of payments methods as may be agreed to by developing countries, without regard to their merits.</al>
							<al>The United States has voted in favour of the Recommendation in Annex A.II.7 concerning competition from synthetics and substitutes because the Recommendation contains many constructive features which may help developing countries in meeting the competition of synthetic products. The United States is opposed, however, to the provisions of sub-paragraph l(xi), regarding the possible use of mixing regulations, since it regards such measures as a restrictive and therefore undesirable method of helping the developing countries.</al>
							<al>The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.II.8 concerning a study of organization of commodity trade. The Recommendation prejudges the results of the proposed study, by its request that a programme of action be drawn up. It also suggests that import purchasing power can and should be stabilized through regulation of commodity prices. For these reasons, the United States could not support the Recommendation.</al>
							<al>The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.II.9 on minerals and fuels.</al>
							<al>The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.III.2 concerning industrial branch agreements. It considers that industrial branch agreements as contemplated in the terms of the Recommendation would tend to impede rather than to further the growth of efficient industries in the developing countries and the expansion of their exports on a sound and enduring basis.</al>
							<al>The United States abstained in the vote on the Recommendation in Annex A.III.7 concerning measures by centrally-planned economies for expansion and diversification of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of developing countries.</al>
							<al>The United States joined in the adoption by consensus of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.8 concerning promotion of trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures among developing countries as it favours efforts of developing countries in the same economic region to join together to form larger markets and to cooperate to achieve accelerated economic development. It does not, however, support the principle that developing countries which are not engaged in this close regional co-operation for development to enter into discriminatory trade relationships of the kind apparently envisaged by the terms of certain provisions of the Recommendation. Accordingly, the United States is opposed to the following provisions of the Recommendation:</al>
							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><al>1. Paragraph (e), Section III;</al></li><li><al>2.

							<al>The United States joined in the adoption by consensus of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.3 concerning criteria for the development of export potential in the developing countries. It notes, however, that recourse to certain of the financial, monetary, fiscal and other aids and incentives mentioned in paragraph 4 of Sub-Section II of Section B of the Recommendation might in certain circumstances give rise to the necessity of considering the application of countervailing duties.</al>
							<al>The United States joined in the adoption by consensus of the Recommendation in Annex A.III.5 concerning trade in manufactures and semi-manufactures. It wishes to record that it is among the countries mentioned in the fourth preambular paragraph of the Recommendation, which are opposed in principle to the extension of preferences by developing countries and which support instead the application of the most-favoured-nation principle in the extension of concessions by developed to developing countries.</al>
							<al>The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.3 (Aims of international financial and technical co-operation).</al>
							<al>The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.IV.13 concerning the needs of the public sector in the transfer of external resources to developing countries.</al>
							<al>The United States voted for the Recommendation in Annex A.V.1 on continuing machinery, on the assumption that such machinery and the procedures to be developed under paragraph 25 of this Recommendation will be acceptable to the developed as well as the developing countries.</al>
							<al>The United States voted against the Recommendation in Annex A.V.2 concerning arrangements during the interim period before the establishment of continuing machinery.</al>

							<al>[Original: French]</al>
							<al>On behalf of the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria and in my own name, I am happy to convey my greetings on the occasion of the historic event of the opening of the International Conference on Trade and Development held under the auspices of the United Nations.</al>
							<al>Algeria attaches the greatest importance to the work of this Conference, which may lead to the positive and lasting solution of the problems confronting the developing countries in particular.</al>
							<al>The organization of the economy of the world, which for so long has been characterized by domination, has led to an inequality of development that is becoming unfavourable to our peoples. Our task today is to seek with faith and determination the means whereby scientific and technical progress can be made to operate to the advantage of all.</al>
							<al>These means exist and are numerous and impressive; they comprise human knowledge, natural resources, agricultural and industrial products, capital etc. It will be the responsibility of the Conference to bring into operation the means and instruments for international economic co-operation on the basis of the principles of respect for the dignity of the human person, social justice and the right of every man and every people to a life of liberty and economic, social and cultural progress.</al>
							<al>It is hardly necessary for me to add that the realization of the conditions for a rapid rise in the standard of living of the peoples of the developing countries constitutes, after the total elimination of colonial rule and racial discrimination, the only way of ensuring a just and durable peace for mankind.</al>
							<al>On behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, I send my best wishes for the success of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</al>

							<al>[Original: French]</al>
							<al>People and Government of Cameroon and myself following with great interest historic meeting now being held Geneva to institute new system for international trade. In a world both too rich and too poor it was becoming urgently necessary that men of good will should consider difficult problems of their trade relations. At a time when man has conquered distance and overcome endemic diseases and infant mortality and when technical progress has opened up vast possibilities of every kind, it was inconceivable that a campaign should not be launched against the anachronistic imbalance in world economic relations. We firmly believe it was high time that the two worlds, on the one hand that of the countries with an embarrassing surplus of foodstuffs and of capital unable find appropriate use at home and on the other countries where hunger, poverty, ignorance, in short underdevelopment, prevail, should hold reasoned discussion. Like other underdeveloped countries Cameroon hopes that your deliberations will result in solutions enabling future to be faced with confidence and promoting harmonious development of all peoples. Highest esteem and consideration.</al>

							<al>Please convey to the United Nations Conference on Trade and

Government and people of the Republic of Ghana. The nations of the world are meeting at a historic moment to consider ways and
means of buttressing the hard-won political independence of developing
countries with collective economic security within the framework
of international trade. More than ever before, all nations must

					</kop>
					<vrije-tekst>
						<tekst status="goed">
							<al>[Original: French]</al>
							<al>This Conference which I have the honour to greet on behalf of the Government and people of Guinea is one of exceptional importance.</al>
							<al>The peoples of the world, more especially those of the developing countries, are rightly turning their eyes and hopes towards Geneva where the delegations will be stating the views of their countries and placing before the conscience of the nations for action equitable solutions to the crucial problem of the harmonious and balanced development of the world economy, of which one of the decisive factors is the system of international trade.</al>
							<al>After the struggle for freedom, each people, in order to enhance its social and cultural values, inevitably embarks on a process of economic development; but it cannot achieve this alone and without the co-operation of other nations.</al>
							<al>The full satisfaction of the needs of man and of society call for economic, technical and financial means the judicious use of which by the physical, intellectual and moral capacities of man or of society must necessarily be in keeping with the level of man's and society's general development and with the objective of their action, which are interconnected. In other words, the speed of development is directly related to the quality and quantity of the means employed and to the ultimate objective.</al>
							<al>It is precisely because all nations do not possess the same natural, technical and financial resources that they are at present at different degrees of development. Any policy tending to perpetuate or widen this difference makes for greater inequality among the peoples and so favours the direct or indirect exploitations of some peoples by others.</al>
							<al>Are the developing countries making an effort inferior to that of the developed countries? We feel sure that the Conference will answer unanimously &#x201C;No!&#x201D; The quality of the means of production undoubtedly has a direct influence on the output and productivity of the worker. Moreover, the whole Conference will agree that the foreign rule endured by some countries for varying periods of time has seriously hampered their economic, social and cultural development.</al>
							<al>Although the attainment of political freedom is taking place at an encouraging speed it must be emphasized that in the case of most of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, it has not been accompanied by economic freedom.</al>
							<al>The international terms of trade are in no way equitable. It is becoming increasingly clear to mankind that the world can be more accurately divided into rich nations that owe their wealth to their high degree of development and poor nations that owe their poverty to lack of development, than into groups with different ideologies.</al>
							<al>To solve the problem of the organization of international trade on equitable foundations such as would bring a just remuneration to the productive efforts of societies is undoubtedly one way of trying to contribute to the progress of the movement for peace throughout the world.</al>
							<al>Coming next in importance only after the freedom of nations, peace depends on the possibility offered to every people to satisfy all its material and moral needs by its work.</al>
							<al>The problem of disarmament yields in importance to the problem of the development of human societies.</al>
							<al>Furthermore, without under-estimating the nature and quality of the decisions which your Conference may reach, we venture to believe that any study concerning the operation of the system of international trade would remain partial and would yield piecemeal solutions if it does not include an examination of the structure and operation of markets with a view to bringing into existence a world organization of economic exchanges and financial relations among nations.</al>
							<al>We believe that your Conference, if it is to be equal to the responsibilities which it is assuming before history, will have to organize its discussions in such a way as to exclude any complex in the relations between the delegations of the developed nations and those of the, developing nations.</al>
							<al>For to start out from the idea that nations should give charity to other nations, or to be more precise, that the industrialized countries will have to lend their assistance in the development of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, would lead the discussions far beyond the requirements of the universal society whose harmonious and balanced development remains the only real factor for mutual understanding, reciprocal friendship and fraternal co-operation among the peoples.</al>
							<al>At this Conference, there are no givers and no receivers of gifts. There are only - and it cannot be otherwise - delegations authorized by their nations to study ways and means, of establishing fair relationships in trade transactions which are at present prejudicial to the interests of the great majority of the peoples of the globe and, consequently, to the strenghtening of the bases of world peace.</al>
							<al>We hope that a spirit of understanding and a determination to move forward will guide your deliberation and will bring them to a positive conclusion, for the benefit not of a part, but of the whole of human society, which has endured too much oppression and exploitation and which longs for a new life, a life in which each people can enjoy true political and economic freedom, security and peace.</al>

							<al>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which opens at Geneva on 23 March, sixteen years after the Havana Conference, is an event of great importance. The less developed countries, of which India is one, are looking hopefully to this Conference to find speedy and effective solutions to their problems of development. The United Nations have taken special interest in promoting the economic development of less developed countries, because poverty is a danger to world peace. It is of the utmost urgency and importance that the developed countries of the world assist others, not so fortunately placed, in the achievement of modest targets of development of the latter through concrete programmes. The prosperity and development of each will contribute to the prosperity of all.</al>

						<tekst status="goed">
							<al>[Original: English]</al>
							<al>It gives me great pleasure to address a message to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which opens in Geneva on 23 March 1964.</al>
							<al>I welcome the initiative that has been taken by the United Nations in convening this Conference, and am gratified indeed by the fact that this initiative was prompted, among others, by the countries, including Indonesia, who are today engrossed in the task of national construction and development.</al>
							<al>The convening of this Conference signifies a growing awareness of the vital need to take effective measures to improve trade relations, to turn trade into an effective instrument for development instead of being a positive hindrance to development as is so frequently the case today.</al>
							<al>One of the Five Pillars of the Republic of Indonesia is Social Justice and by Social Justice we mean the construction of a society that is free of the exploitation of man by man. I recommend to this esteemed Conference to accept this Pillar of Social Justice as the guiding principle for your deliberations. Is is my deepest conviction that by adopting the framework of Social Justice in the larger context of world economic relationships, an unprecedented acceleration can be achieved in bridging the gap between developing and developed nations. In international relations, the implementation of Social Justice can lead to the termination of the exploitation of nation by nation, ending imperialist and colonialist relationship and making it possible for all nations to build up their economies in accordance with their own national interest, harnessing fully the potentials of their own people and exploiting fully their own natural resources, with the ultimate goal of general welfare for all mankind regardless, of rape, colour or creed. Furthermore, by so doing we will be able to keep pace with the tempo of &#x201C;the revolution of rising demands&#x201D; which is sweeping through the most remote corners of our shrinking world.</al>
							<al>I take this opportunity of ensuring you that Indonesia is looking forward to your deliberations with great expectations and is ready to make its contribution to such schemes as you may deem appropriate in pursuance of the common goal of Social Justice. I should like to add, however, that the main emphasis to the effort of each country, to its efforts to free itself from economic dependence and mobilize its own resources, is to rely on its own potentials. Indonesia warmly welcomes international cooperation and is conscious of the value of assistance from other countries, but international cooperation should start with the basic premise that those who cooperate rely first and foremost on their own resources. International assistance can even become a burden if it exceeds its function as an auxiliary or catalyst to a nation's own efforts. What is worse, international cooperation would deteriorate into a curse if it tended to retard the growth of a nation and perpetuate it bondage to outside assistance.</al>
							<al>The task today it to remove all those hindrances to national economic growth, above all by creating the necessary conditions for the promotion of equitable trade relations. Expanding trade stimulates growth, while growth stimulates trade, and once this process begins for all countries in the world there will be no bounds to the advancement of Man, to the riches he will create for the prosperity of all.</al>
							<al>I hope that these understandings will underline your deliberations, for this is the guarantee of success, this is the guarantee that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will be a landmark in the history of Mankind in the striving towards Prosperity and Social Justice.</al>

							<al>
On the occasion of the opening of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, I send cordial greetings to the participants
on behalf of the Government of the Mongolian People's
Republic and on my own behalf. Our Government attaches great
importance to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for the solution of such problems of international economic co-operation as the elimination of all forms of discrimination in international trade for political or other motives, the establishment and expansion of mutually advantageaous economic relations between all States, on a basis of equality, the drafting of effective measures to ensure the economic advancement of developing countries, and the creation of an international trade organization under the aegis of the United Nations, which would concern itself with all questions relating to world trade and would be open to all countries.</al>
							<al>The normalization of international trade is an important means of
relaxing international tension, putting an end to the cold war,
strengthening peace and promoting the peaceful co-existence of
States with aifierent spcial systems.</al>
							<al>The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic endorses the
principle of mutually advantageous international trade, which will
bring peoples closer to one another and serve the cause of peace and
the progress of all mankind. I wish the participants in the Conference
every success in the attainment of the goals of the Conference.</al>

							<al>[Original: French]</al>
							<al>Now that the Conference is approaching the end of its proceedings which we have followed with the closest attention, We take pleasure in offering you Our sincere congratulations on your unceasing efforts for its success and in expressing Our warmest hopes that specific and beneficial resolutions will emerge from the deliberations of this world-wide meeting.</al>
							<al>We are aware of the obstacles which confronted the Conference from the outset, of the numerous and complex questions with which it has had to deal and of the powerful interests that would be involved. It seemed scarcely likely therefore, that a general and final settlement of the difficult problems involved would be reached unanimously in the short time available to the participants. Accordingly We consider it all the more reassuring that the Conference was able to demonstrate so clearly that delegation realized to the full the farreaching nature of the problems which faced them and the need for just and humane solutions.</al>
							<al>In this respect the attitude of the developing countries has been of great significance, and the part they have played in the Conference has provided evidence of their maturity. While pressing their legitimate requests, those countries repeatedly affirmed their belief that development called for a sustained national effort on their part.</al>
							<al>No less remarkable was the attitude of the industrialized countries: instead of confining themselves to useless intransigence, they paid careful attention to the difficulties confronting the developing countries and have shown a sincere desire to promote their progress.</al>
							<al>Is is Our hope therefore that this rapprochement and this desire for co-operation will be the prelude to a general and irresistible movement that will translate into reality throughout the world the ideals of peace and brotherhood which are among Our foremost objectives.</al>

							<al>It gives us considerable pleasure to have the opportunity to say a few words on this occasion. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development presently being attended by all the United Nations member countries, will no doubt find ways to overcome the trading difficulties of the developing countries. Developing countries' present and future development plans largely dependent as they are on their capacity to expand their foreign trade, we hope, the same will receive due consideration of the Conference and we also hope that the difficulties presently experienced by land-locked countries and their justified concern for unrestricted transit facilities will find satisfactory solution. The Conference, as it is one of the measure efforts of the United Nations to diffuse prosperity, will find general approbation and admiration of the people all over the world and in particular, of the people of the developing part of the world.</al>

							<al>[Original: English]</al>
							<al>On behalf of the people and Government of Pakistan and on my own behalf I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for its success. The importance of this gathering cannot be over-emphasised. Indeed since the founding of the United Nations there has been no other Conference on the outcome of which so much of the economic future and well being of humanity has depended. A large part of the world has pinned its hopes on the successful outcome of this Conference. The developing nations of the world are at the cross-roads of history and the future course they take will largely depend on how far this Conference adequately responds to their hopes and aspirations. The economic and trade problems of developing countries have been under study since a long time. The main difficulties, as well as possible remedies, have been identified. What is required now is the political will to evolve and implement an integrated programma of action.</al>
							<al>For a majority of the nations of the world economic progress is today another name for sheer survival. Pakistan, along with other developing nations of the world, is waiting to see how far the international community responds to the challenge of the times so that the appalling conditions in which vast masses of humanity live can be changed and a period of sustained progress leading to decent standards of living ensured within a reasonable future.</al>

							<al>[Original: English]</al>
							<al>Through the Delegation of the Republic of the Philippines to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which has just begun its massively important task, I greet the Honorable Conference President, Secretary-General and other Officers as well as all the Distinguished Delegates in attendance with the fervent hope that the Conference will not merely raise the expectations of two-thirds of humanity but make possible their reasonable fulfilment.</al>
							<al>It scarcely needs stating that the Conference, conceived as an earnest effort to assist the developing nations in improving their economies and enlarging their share of human wellbeing, has already boosted further the rising expectations of the peoples of Asia, Latin America and Africa. This is so, further, because gathered together in mutual counsel at the Palais des Nations in Geneva are the delegations of 122 nations which surely include in their ranks men and women possessed of the profoundest knowledge and experience in all phases of human uplift. If with this near-total mobilization of the world's human wisdom and statesmanship good will in commensurate measure also exists, failure is inconceivable.</al>
							<al>Failure is, indeed, unthinkable. Failure would plunge the developing nations into a new depth of hopelessness and frustration. Failure would earn for the developed nations the disappointment of two-thirds of the world. Failure would deal a fatal blow to the dwindling buying power of the developing nations. Failure would accelerate the progressive loss to the developed nations of their greatest potential markets. Enlightened self-interest on the part of both the developed and developing nations demands not failure but success.</al>
							<al>Looming before all the nations with the increasing brightness of the rising sun is the simple fact that human well-being is indivisible. Nuclear weapons have made war and peace and security indivisible. Continuous and speedy international intercourse has made human health and human expectations indivisible. Wealth and poverty cannot long exist side by side without wealth itself perishing. Wealth must abolish poverty or poverty will liquidate wealth. Human well-being must be for all humanity.</al>
							<al>Strongly believing that the Conference cannot but conceive an improved and enlightened basis of world economic co-operation, I warmly commend those who conceived it in the councils of the United Nations, wish Godspeed to those who are charged with its management and leadership, and offer my prayers that the distinguished delegates will carry on and conclude their vital task with historic vision and wisdom.</al>

							<al>[Original: French]</al>
							<al>Permit me on behalf of the Council of State of the Romanian People's Republic, the Romanian people, and on my own behalf to transmit to you and to all participants best wishes for the complete success of the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</al>
							<al>The Romanian Government sees in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development an important event in the activity of the United Nations, an important event in contemporary international life, which concerns all countries in all regions of the world.</al>
							<al>The Romanian Government hopes that the work of this Conference will contribute to finding the most suitable methods of converting international trade into an efficacious instrument for the economic progress of all countries, and, primarily, the progress of the developing countries.</al>
							<al>Mankind now has at its disposal huge material resources which, together with unexampled advances in science, truly offer opportunities for banishing from our planet economic under-development, the source of poverty, illiteracy and disease. In order that these opportunities may become realities within the reach of all people and every country an end must be put to the armaments race, general and complete disarmament must be achieved, and action must be taken to implement the decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations concerning the immediate liquidation of colonialism in every form. The restrictions and discriminations which impede and distort international economic relations, and especially the trade relations of the developing countries, must be eliminated. International trade must revert to its true functions, its true character, that of a factor for peaceful, mutually advantageous exchanges, contributing to a better understanding among the peoples and to the maintenance of peace.</al>
							<al>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is expected to make its contribution towards the achievement of these aims, and so to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of millions and millions of human beings in all regions of the world.</al>
							<al>With these considerations in mind, the Romanian Government has attached special attention to the preparation of Romania's participation it the Conference's work. As you know, the Romanian delegation at the sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations and on other occasions have warmly supported the idea and have stressed the need for convening this Conference.</al>
							<al>Actuated by the wish to make its contribution to the establishment of an agenda covering the most important problems of a broad and unimpeded development of international trade, the Romanian Government has prepared certain proposals of general interest, based on the positive experience of international economic relations and requiremeats.</al>
							<al>We hope that these proposals will be considered during the Conference's debates with all due attention, together with the constructive proposals of other countries.</al>
							<al>Romania is interested in the establishment of normal economic relations among States and considers that such relations should be based on the principles of strict respect for national sovereignty, the equality of rights, non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual advantage.</al>
							<al>The Romanian Government has always considered, and still considers, that the United Nations has an important part to play in this matter and, in conformity with the fundamental terms of the Charter, should promote measures tending to contribute to the expansion of international economic co-operation, to economic development and to the raising of levels of living throughout the world.</al>
							<al>For this purpose, Romania has, since the twelfth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, been advocating the preparation of a declaration on the principles of international economic co-operation.</al>
							<al>At its last session the General Assembly of the United Nations endorsed the idea that such a declaration might be an effective instrument for the establishment of stable, sound and equitable relations among all States.</al>
							<al>The Romanian Government hopes that the deliberations of the Conference will proceed in a spirit of understanding and co-operation and that they will approach the modern problems of international trade and economic development realistically and constructively, taking into consideration the profound changes which have occurred in the world and recognizing that all countries have the right to economic and social development.</al>

							<al>[Original: French]</al>
							<al>The evolution of the modern world, characterised by spectacular advances in science and technology and, secondly, by the ending of the colonial era and by the liberation of productive forces long enslaved to the purposes of exploitation, opens up the broadest prospects for trade and international economic co-operation.</al>
							<al>Trade has been from time immemorial an instrument for the exchange of wealth and skills among the peoples, but it has nowadays become the means by which every economy is nourished and breathes and the living expression of a profound solidarity of interests among men, irrespective of their mode of life and their political and social system.</al>
							<al>Consequently, it is the responsibility of the United Nations to organize international trade in conformity with the purposes and principles of its Charter and so to correct the imbalances and inequalities inherited from an anachronistic system unsuited to the spirit of our time. It is a task necessary for the maintenance of peace and for the strengthening of co-operation and friendship among the peoples.</al>
							<al>Tunisia has at all times, and with conviction and unreservedly, supported the activities of the United Nations and is once again ready to make its contribution, however modest, to the common effort. It trusts sincerely that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will not disappoint the hopes of the developing countries, which are genuinely anxious to find the formula for a balanced and harmonious co-operation working to the mutual advantage of all nations.</al>

							<al>[Original: Russian]</al>
							<al>On behalf of the Soviet Government and on my own behalf I
extend cordial greetings to the participants in the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development. The Soviet Government expresses its gratification at the opening of this Conference, the
convening of which was due in part to the initiative of the Soviet
Union.</al>
							<al>We are glad that the idea of convening the Conference met with
such wide support throughout the world particularly on the part of
the developing countries, and that it has now become a reality. We
are convinced that trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit
is a good basis for the peaceful co-existence of countries with different
social systems and creates favourable conditions for the further
relaxation of international tension and the consolidation of peace
throughout the world.</al>
							<al>Our era is characterized by the desire of the independence States
of Asia, Africa and Latin America to put an end to economic backwardness
in the shortest possible time and to achieve progress in all
spheres of human endeavour. International trade and economic
co-operation, based on respect of sovereignty and a desire to take
into account the vital needs of the developing countries, will be an
excellent addition to the efforts made by those countries to eliminate
the vestiges of colonialism in their economy and foreign trade and
to raise the level of their independent national economy. It is common
knowledge that the present state of world trade fails in many
respects to fulfil the great hopes which the peoples of the world place
in it. The inequitable international division of labour and the constantly
widening gap between the prices of the goods exported by
the developing countries and the prices of the goods imported by
them, which is causing depletion of their resources and hampering
their development, are the result of imperialist exploitation. Discrimination
and artificial barriers check the growth of international
trade and poison the political atmosphere. As regards the Soviet
Union, it is consistently pursuing the policy of developing trade and
economic relations with all countries of the world on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit. Evidence of this is the steady growth
of the foreign trade of the USSR. We shall continue in future to
devote great attention to the development of trade and economic
co-operation with all countries which are interested in this, and in
particular with the developing countries. As participants in this
extremely important Conference, you are faced with important and
noble tasks, namely, to secure better conditions for the development
of world trade on the basis of equitable principles, which would help
to normalize trade, to eliminate artificial barriers and discrimination,
and to ensure all countries an appropriate place in the international
division of labour, as well as to work out practical measures for the
expansion of international trade and economic co-operation, and to
set up effective organizational machinery with a view to the earliest
possible implementation of the resolutions of the Conference. This requires a bold, just and unprejudiced approach to the solution of
the problems confronting the Conference.</al>
							<al>The Soviet Government convinced that trade and economic cooperation
between peoples can and must make an enormous contribution
to the strengthening of peace and co-operation among peoples,
wishes the Conference every success and expresses the hope that it
will open a new page in the history of international economic relations.</al>

measures in a more organized and comprehensive manner,
with the aim of promoting universal and equal economic co-operation
in order to accelerate economic development in the world and to
eliminate the existing obstacles impeding international economic
co-operation and stabilization of situation in the world.</al>
							<al>General concurrence of all countries on the need and usefulness
of having this Conference convened, is, no doubt, encouraging.
Furthermore, it offers sound basis for hopes placed in it. The prevailing international relations, as demonstrated, did not make possible
the solving of a number of outstanding problems.</al>
							<al>One of these major problems, by all standards, is the unequal
development in the world and its impact upon the international relations.
This problem, in a greater measure, constitutes a key problem
not only to the further progress of insufficiently developed areas,
but, we are firmly convinced, to the further prosperity of the industrially
developed countries as well.</al>
							<al>The rapid economic and social development of those countries
which have only recently gained their independence, permitting them
to integrate themselves into international economic co-operation on
an equal footing, is a matter of immediate urgency. An effective
international action, which does not brook delay, is necessary towards
this end.</al>
							<al>Likewise, the elimination of various obstacles standing in the way
of broad international co-operation, will, no doubt, in addition to
yielding economic gains contribute considerably towards improved
relations among nations and States in general.</al>
							<al>We are convinced that all countries feel that it is in their own
interest to exert the necessary efforts towards the resolving of
problems facing this Conference. We sincerely hope that the recommendations
and decisions of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development will pay due attention to the interest of all
countries, irrespective of the level of development and differences
in the social and economic systems and that they will constitute a
genuine contribution to the promoting of international co-operation
and the safeguarding of peace.</al>

countries of cotton fibre, jute, wool, tea, bananas, pineapples,
spices, and certain products of mining industry and primary
products for chemical industry. The purchases in the developing
countries of manufactures and semi-manufactures under trade agreements,
including repayment of credits granted by the Soviet Union
to these countries, shall also be increased.</al>

earnings of the developing countries.&#x201D;

to annually increase trade with the developing countries and welcomes
the data provided by a number of delegations of the socialist
countries as trade development estimates for 1970 and 1980.&#x201D;</al></li><li><al>
&#x201C;It is understood by the Conference that the statement of a number
of delegations of the socialist countries on eventual development
of trade reflects the aims of these countries and that the increase of imports of socialist countries from the developing countries should
be accompanied by the rise in purchases of the developing countries
in socialist countries as well as by the general normalization of
world trade.&#x201D;</al></li><li><al>&#x201C;The Conference notes the readiness of the socialist countries to
enter into multilateral as well as bilateral trade agreements including
long-term ones when it appears economically advantageous for the

countries to gradually facilitate the transferability of credit balances.&#x201D;</al></li></lijst>
