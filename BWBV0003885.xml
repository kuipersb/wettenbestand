  <al>THE HAGUE</al>
  <al>31 August 1979.</al>
  <al>Dear Secretary-General,</al>
  <al>I have the honour to refer to the Agreement on the Status of the North
	 Atlantic Treaty Organization, National Representatives and International Staff
	 signed at Ottawa on 20 September 1951, hereinafter called the Ottawa
	 Agreement.</al>
  <al>Considering that my Government has offered to collocate the NATO
	 AEW&amp;C (Airborne Early Warning and Control) Programme Management Agency
	 (NAPMA), the executive body of the NATO AEW&amp;C Programme Management
	 Organization (NAPMO), together with the Headquarters of the Allied Forces
	 Central Europe at Brunssum in the Netherlands and considering that my
	 Government is prepared to grant privileges and exemptions to NAPMO on
	 conditions that are as a whole no less favourable than those granted to date by
	 the Belgian Government my Government deems it desirable to formulate certain
	 provisions together with you as a supplement to the Ottawa Agreement. In order
	 to facilitate the collocation, my Government deems it desirable to come to such
	 arrangements that the privileges and exemptions accorded to NAPMO and its
	 officials and experts will be on a par with those already established for
	 AFCENT and his personnel.</al>
  <al>To this end I have the honour to propose the following provisions:</al>
  <lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet">

	 <li><li.nr>6.</li.nr>
		<al>The aforementioned officials shall have the same privileges as AFCENT
		  personnel with respect to the exemption of taxes levied on goods sold in the
		  messes, bars and canteens. The kinds and quantities of goods that may be
		  procured free of duty and/ or tax are those determined in agreement with the
		  competent Netherlands authorities for AFCENT personnel. They shall also be
		  exempt from motorvehicle tax in the same manner as AFCENT personnel.</al>

		<al>The experts referred to in Article 21 of the Ottawa Agreement who are
		  employed in the Netherlands in direct support of NAPMO for a minimum period of

		  accorded the privileges and exemptions referred to in paragraph 6;</al>
	 </li>
