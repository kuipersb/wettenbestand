          <al>Airlines of each Implementing Entity designated under this Annex shall,
in accordance with the terms of their designation, have the right to carry
international charter traffic of passengers (and their accompanying baggage)
and/or cargo (including, but not limited to, freight forwarder, split, and
combination (passenger/cargo) charters):</al>

that has designated the airline and any point or points in the territory of
the other Implementing Entity; and </al>

Entity and any point or points in a third country or countries, provided that,
except with respect to cargo charters, such service constitutes part of a
continuous operation, with or without a change of aircraft, that includes
service to the homeland for the purpose of carrying local traffic between
the homeland and the territory of the other Implementing Entity.</al>
          <al>In the performance of services covered by this Annex, airlines of each
Implementing Entity designated under this Annex shall also have the right:
(1) to make stopovers at any points whether within or outside of the territory
of either Implementing Entity; (2) to carry transit traffic through the other
Implementing Entity's territory; (3) to combine on the same aircraft traffic
originating in one Implementing Entity's territory, traffic originating in
the other Implementing Entity's territory, and traffic originating in third
countries; and (4) to perform international air transportation without any
limitation as to change, at any point on the route, in type or number of aircraft
operated; provided that, except with respect to cargo charters, in the outbound
direction, the transportation beyond such point is a continuation of the transportation
from the territory of the Implementing Entity that has designated the airline
and in the inbound direction, the transportation to the territory of the Implementing
Entity that has designated the airline is a continuation of the transportation
from beyond such point.</al>
          <al>Each Implementing Entity shall extend favorable consideration to applications
by airlines of the other Implementing Entity to carry traffic not covered
by this Annex on the basis of comity and reciprocity.</al>
