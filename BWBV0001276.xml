          <al>Recognising that the prevailing, often adverse, sea and weather
            conditions with low visibility, the low water temperatures, the need
            to maintain intensive all year round ro-ro passenger ferry services,
            the public dependence on such services, recent accidents and the
            density of ro-ro passenger ship movements and potentially
            conflicting shipping movements at particular locations require the
            application of specific stability requirements to all ro-ro
            passenger ships operating regular scheduled voyages between or to or
            from designated ports in North West Europe and the Baltic Sea;    </al>

              case defined for compliance with paragraph 2.3.2 of SOLAS
              regulation II&#x2013;1/8 (SOLAS 90). An additional test is required at a

              for not less than 30 min in full-scale time. A different wave

              the model should be given an additional 1&#xB0; angle of heel towards

              two specified wave conditions. The purpose of these additional
