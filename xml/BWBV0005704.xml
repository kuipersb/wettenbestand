					<al>The Hague, January 8, 1952.</al><al> No. 385</al>
					<al>Excellency:</al>
					<al>I have the honor to refer to the conversations which have recently taken place between representatives of our two Governments relating to the Economic Cooperation Agreement between the United States of America and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed at The Hague on July 2, 1948, as heretofore amended, to the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between our two Governments, signed at Washington, D.C. on January 27, 1950, and to the enactment by the Congress of the United States of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, Public Law 165, 82nd Congress. I also have the honor to confirm the understandings reached as a result of these conversations, as follows:</al>
					<al>The Government of the Netherlands has expressed adherence to the purposes and policies of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948 as heretofore amended, including the statement of purpose contained in Section 2 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, which recognizes the primary importance of strengthening the mutual security and individual and collective defenses of the free world, developing their resources in the interest of the security and independence and national interest of friendly countries and facilitating the effective participation of those countries in the United Nations system for collective security.</al>
					<al>Whenever reference is made in any of the articles of such Economic Cooperation Agreement to the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, or of such Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, as amended, such reference shall be construed as meaning the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, or the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, respectively, as heretofore amended.</al>
