          <al>The Royal Netherlands Embassy to the Kyrgyz Republic presents its
            compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz
            Republic, and has the honor to refer to recent discussions between
            representatives of our two governments regarding issues related to
            Dutch military and civilian personnel of the Ministry of Defence of
            the Netherlands who may be present in the Kyrgyz Republic in
            connection with cooperative efforts in response to terrorism,
            humanitarian assistance and other agreed activities.</al>
          <lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet"><li><li.nr>1.</li.nr><al>The Royal Netherlands Embassy has the honor to request
            assistance and permission to use Kyrgyz Republic facilities, to
            include Manas International Airport, for humanitarian assistance,
            combat and combat support for operations in support of Operation
            Enduring Freedom and, as required, the International Security
            Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The Government of the
            Kingdom of the Netherlands will coordinate activities at Manas
            International Airport with the Ministry of Transport and
            Communications, airport authorities, and other appropriate
            authorities to ensure that operations and activities do not
            interfere with civilian flight operations.</al></li><li><li.nr>2.</li.nr><al> As a result of these discussions, the Embassy proposes that
            such personnel be accorded a status equivalent to that accorded to
            the administrative and technical staff of the Royal Netherlands
            Embassy under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations of April
            18, 1961; that Dutch personnel be permitted to enter and exit the
            Kyrgyz Republic with Dutch identification and with collective
            movement or individual travel orders; that the Kyrgyz authorities
            shall accept as valid, without a driving fee or test, driving
            licenses or permits issued by the appropriate Dutch authorities to
            Dutch personnel for the operation of vehicles; and that such
            personnel be authorized to wear uniforms while performing official
            duties and to carry weapons when their orders call for it.</al></li><li><li.nr>3.</li.nr><al> The Embassy further proposes that vehicles and aircraft owned
            or operated by or for the Armed Forces of the Kingdom of the
            Netherlands shall not be subject to the payment of landing,
            navigation, overflight or parking charges, overland transit fees, or
            similar charges while in the Kyrgyz Republic; however, the Armed
            Forces of the Kingdom of the Netherlands shall pay reasonable
            charges for services requested and received. In this respect the
            Kingdom of the Netherlands agrees that Manas International Airport
            shall be designated as a commercial airport and as such Government
            of the Netherlands aircraft will pay reasonable fees, based upon
            International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) schedules, for
            parking and landing at this airport. Aircraft and vehicles of the
            Netherlands shall be free of inspections.</al></li><li><li.nr>4.</li.nr><al> The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its military
            and civilian personnel, contractors and contractor personnel shall
            not be liable to pay any tax or similar charge assessed within the
            territory of the Kyrgyz Republic.</al></li><li><li.nr>5.</li.nr><al> The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its military
            and civilian personnel, contractors and contractor personnel may
            import into, export out of, and use in the Kyrgyz Republic any
            personal property, equipment, supplies, materials, technology,
            training or services required to implement this agreement. Such
            importation, exportation and use shall be exempt from any
            inspection, license, other restrictions, customs duties, taxes or
            any other charges assessed within the territory of the Kyrgyz
            Republic. The Governments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and of
            the Kyrgyz Republic shall cooperate in taking such steps as shall be
            necessary to ensure the security of Dutch personnel and property in
            the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic.</al></li><li><li.nr>6.</li.nr><al> In the event that the Government of the Kingdom of the
            Netherlands awards contracts for the acquisition of articles and
            services, including construction, to implement this agreement, such
            contracts shall be awarded in accordance with the laws and
            regulations of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
            Acquisition of articles and services in the Kyrgyz Republic by or on
            behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in
            implementing this agreement shall not be subject to any taxes,
            customs duties or similar charges in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic.</al></li><li><li.nr>7.</li.nr><al> The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic recognizes the particular
            importance of disciplinary control by Dutch military authorities
            over Dutch personnel and, therefore, the Government of the Kyrgyz
            Republic authorizes the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
            to exercise criminal jurisdiction over such personnel.</al></li><li><li.nr>8.</li.nr><al> The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic recognizes that it shall
            be necessary for Dutch personnel and systems to use the appropriate
            frequencies of the radio spectrum. The Government of the Kingdom of
            the Netherlands shall be allowed to operate its own
            telecommunication systems (as telecommunication is defined in the
            1992 constitution of the international telecommunication union).
            This shall include the right to utilize such means and services as
            required to assure full ability to operate telecommunication
            systems, and the right to use all necessary radio spectrum for this
            purpose. Use of radio spectrum owned by the Government of the Kyrgyz
            Republic shall be free of cost. Privately owned frequencies will be
            compensated for by mutual agreement of parties.</al></li><li><li.nr>9.</li.nr><al> The Embassy proposes that, other than contractual claims, the
            parties waive any and all claims against each other for damage to,
            loss or destruction of property owned by each party, or death or
            injury to any military or civilian personnel of the Armed Forces of
            either party, arising out of activities in the Kyrgyz Republic under
            this document. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
            shall pay, in accordance with Dutch law, fair and reasonable
            compensation in settlement of meritorious claims by third parties,
            as determined by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands,
            arising out of acts or omissions of Dutch personnel, or which are
            otherwise incident to noncombat activities of the Armed Forces of
            the Kingdom of the Netherlands under this Agreement.</al></li><li><li.nr>10.</li.nr><al> Finally, the Embassy proposes that the Agreement herein
            proposed shall have a term of one year from the date of entry into
            force and thereafter shall continue to be in force unless terminated
            by either Party on 30 days written notice through the diplomatic channels.</al></li><li><li.nr>11.</li.nr><al>If the foregoing is acceptable to the Government of the Kyrgyz
            Republic, the Embassy proposes that this note, together with the
            Ministry's reply to that effect, shall constitute an Agreement
            between the two Governments that will be applied provisionally after
            the receipt by the Royal Netherlands Embassy to the Kyrgyz Republic
            of a note from the Ministry of foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz
            Republic, and shall finally enter into force upon notification by
            the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Government of the
            Kingdom of the Netherlands that it has completed all of its internal
            procedures for entry into force.</al></li></lijst>
