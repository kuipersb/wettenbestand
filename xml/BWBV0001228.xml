cornerstone of European security and their adherence to its goals and objectives.
It is in their common interest to preserve the integrity of the Treaty and
the Concluding Act as well as the predictability and transparency they have
created. The States Parties reaffirm their determination to fulfil in good
faith all obligations and commitments arising from the Treaty and its associated
documents. Bearing that in mind, they commit themselves to enhance the viability
and effectiveness of the Treaty.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">2</nr></kop><al> The negotiation, conclusion and implementation of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref> and the
Concluding Act, as well as the ratification of the Treaty, took place in times
of change during which the European security environment evolved significantly.
The Warsaw Treaty Organization has ceased to exist. New States have emerged
and became States Parties to the Treaty. At the same time, new risks and challenges
to security have come to the fore. As a result of common efforts of the States
Parties, the Treaty and the Concluding Act have remained vital stabilizing
factors in this period of transition and contributed to its peaceful unfolding.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">3</nr></kop><al> The States Parties stress that security and stability in Europe are
vitally underpinned by the continuation and enhancement of robust arms control
measures. Recognizing the evolution of the European political and security
environment, the States Parties are resolved to continue the conventional
arms control process, including through the enhancement of the viability and
effectiveness of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref>. They see this as a common responsibility.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">4</nr></kop><al> The States Parties recognize that the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref> and the Concluding Act
are essential contributions to the achievement of the goals and purposes of
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), in particular
the promotion of confidence, stability and security in an undivided Europe.
In that context, they stress the importance of the development of a common
and comprehensive security model for Europe for the twenty-first century,
of the implementation of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0001051" compleet="nee">Treaty on Open Skies</extref> and of the ongoing security
dialogue and negotiations in the Forum for Security Co-operation.</al></artikel></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><nr status="officieel">II</nr><titel status="officieel">REVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF THE <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">TREATY</extref> AND THE CONCLUDING ACT</titel></kop><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">5</nr></kop><al> The States Parties note with satisfaction that more than 58,000 pieces
of conventional armaments and equipment have been reduced, and that the overall
holdings of conventional armaments and equipment within the area of application
are substantially lower than the limits set in the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref>.</al><al>More than 2,500 inspections have taken place. A permanent system for regular
and routine exchange of Treaty notifications and other information has been
developed. The Joint Consultative Group has been firmly established and has
demonstrated its utility and importance as the ongoing Treaty forum.</al>
          <al>With regard to the Concluding Act, the States Parties note with satisfaction
that the personnel strength of conventional armed forces in the area of application
was reduced by 1.2 million persons.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">6</nr></kop><al> The States Parties note that the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref> established a high degree of
transparency in military relations through its comprehensive system for exchange
of information and for verification. Together with the extensive reductions
of conventional armaments and equipment, this has led to greater predictability
and confidence in security relations. The Treaty has also nurtured the development
of new patterns of co-operation in Europe and provides a basis for stability
and enhanced security in Europe at substantially lower levels of conventional
armaments and equipment than heretofore. Although risks and challenges still
exist in some parts of Europe, the capability for launching surprise attack
and the danger of large-scale offensive action in Europe as a whole have been
diminished substantially. Nevertheless, the achievement of the goals of the
Treaty in the whole area of its application requires continuous efforts by
the States Parties.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">7</nr></kop><al> The States Parties reaffirm the continued relevance of the basic structures
of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref>, including the principle of zonal limitations, as embodied in
<extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009&amp;artikel=IV" compleet="nee">Articles IV</extref> and <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009&amp;artikel=V" compleet="nee">V of the Treaty</extref>. In this respect, and in line with the Decision
of the Joint Consultative Group of 17 November 1995, the States Parties have
agreed on a Document, which is contained in Annex A, reflecting a combination
of measures agreed in co-operative fashion and acceptable to all Parties to
the Treaty.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">8</nr></kop><al> The States Parties regret that not all reduction obligations pursuant
to the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref> have been met. They stress the necessity to complete as soon
as possible reductions of conventional armaments and equipment limited by
the Treaty (TLE) in accordance with obligations under the Treaty. They note
with satisfaction the reiterated commitment of those States Parties which
still have to complete reductions to comply with the provisions of the Treaty
and its associated documents. All States Parties express their readiness to
follow this process to its completion in accordance with the provisions of
the Treaty. In this context, being aware of difficulties which have delayed
the completion of reductions, they take positive note of efforts undertaken
in order to meet fully obligations under the Treaty.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">9</nr></kop><al> The States Parties express their concern with serious difficulties
of some States Parties to comply fully, within their territory, with the provisions
of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref> and its related documents due to TLE unaccounted for and uncontrolled
within the Treaty. This situation adversely affects the operation of the Treaty
and complicates its implementation.</al>
          <al>They stress the need to reach as soon as possible relevant political solutions
and to elaborate necessary measures to enable the implementation of the Treaty
in accordance with its provisions.</al>
          <al>They express their readiness to address the issue of this TLE in the Joint
Consultative Group, including the ways and means to facilitate the resolution
of this issue.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">10</nr></kop><al> The States Parties have adopted the understandings and agreed interpretations
with regard to implementation and ways and means to improve the viability
and effectiveness of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref> as specified in Annex B of this Final Document.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">11</nr></kop><al> The States Parties have agreed that the implementation issues contained
in Annex  C of this Final Document require further consideration and resolution
in the Joint Consultative Group.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">12</nr></kop><al> The States Parties reaffirm the arrangements regarding <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009&amp;artikel=XII" compleet="nee">Article XII</extref>
reached at the Extraordinary Conference in Oslo in 1992.</al>
          <al>They understand that for successor States that had become States Parties
by 1992, paragraph 2 of the Article XII part of the Oslo arrangement should
be read as: &#x201C;In particular, no State Party will increase within the area
of application its holdings of armoured infantry fighting vehicles held by
organizations designed and structured to perform in peacetime internal security
functions above that aggregate number held by such organizations at the time
of signature of the Treaty, as notified on their territory pursuant to the
information exchange as of November 19, 1990."</al>
          <al>They agree to work further on the issue of Article XII in the Joint Consultative
Group, taking into account the proposals made at the Review Conference.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">13</nr></kop><al> The States Parties stressed the importance of full and continuous
respect for the provisions of <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009&amp;artikel=IV" compleet="nee">Article IV, paragraph 5</extref>, in the context of maintaining
the viability of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref>, as well as for the sovereignty of the States
Parties involved.</al>
          <al>The States Parties noted that, in certain instances, bilateral agreements
are under negotiation &#x2013; or in the process of ratification or implementation &#x2013;
which relate to the provisions of Article IV, paragraph 5. The States Parties
expressed their support for early and positive results of the ongoing process.</al>
          <al>The States Parties consider that the importance of the Article IV provisions
on stationing forces should be recognized in the context of the process foreseen
in Section III of this Final Document.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr status="officieel">14</nr></kop><al> In the context of the process foreseen in Section I  II of this Final

the Russian  Federation to promote the implementation of the statement of

Parties will consider measures and adaptations with the aim of promoting the
objectives of the Treaty and of enhancing its viability and effectiveness,
including but not limited to the consideration of proposals already made to

          <al>&#x201C;The Georgian Delegation has considered paragraphs 2 and 3 of Section

          <al>Any agreement on temporary deployment of conventional armed forces on
the territory of Georgia or on the reallocation of equipment quotas established
by the Tashkent Agreement must be the result of free negotiation and must
be taken with full respect for the sovereignty of Georgia and for its Constitution.
All Parties must implement all the provisions of any such agreements in good
faith and in accordance with the provisions of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0002009" compleet="nee">Treaty</extref>."</al><tussenkop kopopmaak="cur">Statement by the Delegation of Moldova at the First Conference
