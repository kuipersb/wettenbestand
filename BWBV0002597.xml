</kop><vrije-tekst><tekst status="goed"><al>Rome, Italy</al><al>April 29, 1986</al><al>Dear Mr. Ambassador:</al><al>I have the honor to refer to the agreement by an exchange of letters of March 2 and 4,1982 between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), and related understandings and extensions, regarding the participation of the Netherlands in the MFO.</al><al>Pursuant to this agreement, the Netherlands has contributed a contingent principally composed of a Military Signals Unit and the Force Military Police Unit (FMPU). While the agreement describes the overall complement of the Contingent as "approximately 105 personnel", the number of each of these two units was fixed in Annex I to the agreement.</al><al>An early appreciation that the FMPU required additional personnel to perform its duties satisfactorily led to an increase in the unit from the envisioned 21 personnel to a current total of 23. The Provost Marshal has now indicated a requirement for 10 additional personnel; this conclusion has been endorsed by Lieutenant General Ingebrigtsen, the Force Commander, and by this Headquarters. This request is based on the need to improve monitoring and control of movements of MFO personnel and supplies across the international boundary between Egypt and Israel; the dedication of certain non-commissioned officers to specialized functions of continuing importance to current FMPU operations, particularly special drug and technical vehicle accident investigations; and the recent loss by the FMPU of four military police who had been temporarily attached to the FMPU by another contingent in order to assist the FMPU in meeting current demands. Taking into account appropriate allowances for leave and off-duty periods, these factors, in our opinion, amply justify this proposed increase.</al><al>I therefore have the honor to propose that the Netherlands Government agree, on this basis and in the interest of maintaining a certain degree of flexibility in staffing subject to case-by-case approval of the MFO and the Netherlands authorities, to provide the MFO with a contingent composed of approximately 117 personnel, consisting of officers serving in agreed positions on the staff of the Force Commander, the Signals Unit at the level of approximately 81 personnel, as at present, and the FMPU composed of approximately 33 personnel, which includes the proposed increase. If the foregoing is agreeable to your Government, on the understanding that all other aspects of the agreement by exchange of letters of March 2 and 4, 1982 and related understandings and extensions remain unaffected, I have the honor to propose that this Note, together with your affirmative reply, shall constitute an agreement between the MFO and the Kingdom of the Netherlands effective on the date of your reply.</al><al>Please accept the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.</al><al>(sd.)
