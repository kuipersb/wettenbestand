      <vrije-tekst><tekst status="goed"><al>The Hague, 17 December 2003 </al>
          <al>Dear Secretary General,</al>
          <al>I have the honour to refer to the Agreement on the Status of the
            North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, National Representatives and
            International Staff signed at Ottawa on 20 September 1951
            (hereinafter called the Ottawa Agreement) and to the Agreement
            between the Parties of the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the
            status of their forces, signed in London on 19 June 1951
            (hereinafter called the London Agreement).</al>
          <al>Considering:</al>
          <al>that in the context of the dissolution of NATO Communications and
            Information Systems Organisation (NACISO) and SHAPE Technical Center
            (STC) and the establishment of the NATO Consultation, Command and
            Control Organisation (hereinafter called NC3O) on 1st July 1996, the
            Netherlands Government has agreed to the establishment in The
            Netherlands of a part of the NC3O: the NATO Consultation, Command
            and Control Agency (NC3A) that represents the legal successor
            organisation of STC; </al>
          <al>that the NC3O Charter (PO(96)99) foresees that the NATO
            Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) shall comprise a
            civilian and military element (hereinafter called NC3A personnel);</al>
          <al>that the civilian personnel will be deemed to be NATO
            International Personnel and shall be covered by the Ottawa
            Agreement, and the military component will be deemed to be members
            of the International Military Staff and shall be covered by the
            London Agreement;</al>
          <al>that the Netherlands Government is prepared to grant privileges
            and immunities to NC3A and its personnel in The Netherlands that are
            no less favourable than those previously granted to STC and with
            regard to the military component, than those granted to
            International Military Headquarters in the Netherlands.</al>
          <al>Now therefore the Netherlands Government deems it desirable to
            formulate certain provisions together with you as a supplement to
            the Ottawa Agreement and to the London Agreement as applicable.</al>
          <al>To this end I have the honour to propose the following provisions:</al>
