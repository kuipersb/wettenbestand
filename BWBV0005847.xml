          <al>Subject: Request to the Government of the Netherlands to host a <nadruk type="vet">Joint IAEA /EC-JRC Regional Workshop on Precursor, Transient and Root Cause Analyses</nadruk> in Petten, Netherlands, from <nadruk type="vet">20</nadruk> to <nadruk type="vet">24 August 2012 </nadruk></al><al>Sir,</al>
          <al>I have the honour to refer to earlier consultations, at the technical level, between the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and representatives of your Government concerning the organization of the above workshop from 20 to 24 August 2012 within the framework of the IAEA technical cooperation project RER/9/126 &#x201C;Advancing Safety Assessment Capabilities, Harmonizing Safety Assessments and Creating Synergy between Deterministic and Probabilistic Safety Analyses&#x201D;.</al>
          <al>The purpose of the workshop is to present various event investigation methodologies suitable for use by nuclear power plants, regulatory bodies or technical support organizations, recognizing the fact that all events are not alike and therefore require different techniques in order to be properly analysed. Approximately 20 persons from 18 nominating countries are expected to attend, as well as representative(s) from the lAEA.</al>
          <al>I have the honour to inquire whether your Government would wish to host this workshop and, if so, whether your Government would agree to make the following arrangements:</al>

              <li.nr>1.</li.nr>
              <al>The Government of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the Government) will accord to the IAEA, its property, funds and assets, and to the officials of the IAEA and participants officially designated to attend the workshop in their official capacities, and to members of the immediate families of such persons, the privileges and immunities contained in the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0004919" compleet="nee">Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency</extref>, which was accepted by the Government on 29 August 1963.</al>

              <al>The Government will accord to the persons mentioned above every facility necessary for the performance of their functions in connection with the workshop, including entering, remaining in and leaving the Netherlands. The Government will issue any necessary visas as expeditiously as possible and, where the legislation of the Netherlands permits, free of charge. The Government, however, reserves the right to deny, irrespective of nationality, visas to individual participants for national security reasons. <intref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0005847&amp;verdragtekst=A">Annex A</intref> contains the list of Member States to be invited to participate in the workshop.</al>
              <al>The IAEA will inform the Government promptly of all persons officially designated to attend the workshop. The IAEA will also advise such persons to apply for visas, if necessary, in good time before the opening date of the workshop, and the Government is expected to issue such visas promptly so as to allow them to attend the workshop.</al>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <li.nr>5.</li.nr>
              <al>The Government will exercise reasonable care to ensure security on the premises where the workshop takes place and to ensure the safety of the persons mentioned in paragraph I above while they are on those premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonable in the circumstances to ensure such security and safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.</al>

          <al>I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr Manuel Martin Ramos, Institute for Energy and Transport of the European Commission Joint Research Centre, who has so far been our principal contact regarding the workshop.</al>
