The Netherlands, Romania and Turkey. An invitation to attend in an observer
capacity will be sent to the European Community, World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) and the FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease

Accordingly, representatives of Governments and officials of FAO performing
official functions in connection with the Session will enjoy the privileges
and immunities provided by Articles V and VI of the Convention. FAO declares
that participants from organizations are experts on mission within the meaning
of Annex II and VII to the Convention, and consequently it is agreed that
they will enjoy the privileges and immunities provided by those Annexes.</al>
