              <al> Under article 2 of the Extradition Treaty between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the United States of America, done at The Hague, June 24,
1980, the contracting parties are obliged to extradite to each other persons
for the purpose of prosecution or service of sentence. Article 8 of the Treaty
provides that in the event there is a treaty in force between the contracting
parties on the execution of foreign penal sanctions, neither contracting party
may refuse to extradite its own nationals solely on the basis of their nationality. </al>

            <li>
              <li.nr>2.</li.nr>
              <al> The Government of the United States of America has been apprised of
the Netherlands extradition act, as amended in 1986, which makes an exception
to the prohibition on the extradition of Netherlands citizens, which had been
in force until then, to the effect that that prohibition shall not apply if
the extradition of a Netherlands citizen has been requested for the purpose
of a criminal investigation directed against him and it has been guaranteed
to the satisfaction of the Netherlands Minister of Justice that, if the person
concerned receives a custodial sentence in the requesting state for the offence
for which he may extradited, he will be allowed to serve his sentence in the
Netherlands.</al>
            </li>
            <li>
              <li.nr>3.</li.nr>
              <al> The United States of America is party to the Convention of 21 March
1983 on the transfer of sentenced persons and shall perform its obligations
under that Convention. The Government of the United States of America has
no objection, in principle, to the transfer of Netherlands nationals to the
Kingdom of the Netherlands in order to serve sentence imposed on them in the
United States of America, and, pursuant to the provisions of that Convention,
shall consider in good faith requests by the Government of the Kingdom of
the Netherlands for the transfer of convicted Netherlands citizens to the
Netherlands. Requests for transfer will be considered after judgment in the
case is final in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.</al>
            </li>
            <li>
              <li.nr>4.</li.nr>
              <al> The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands shall consider the
present exchange of notes as sufficient guarantee as required under its domestic
legislation to enable the extradition of Netherlands citizens in accordance
with the Extradition Treaty and its extradition law. This means that the Kingdom
of the Netherlands will not require additional assurances on this point in
individual cases.</al>

            <li>
              <li.nr>5.</li.nr>
              <al> As soon as the application of the Convention on the transfer of sentenced
persons of 21 March 1983 shall be extended to the Netherlands Antilles and
Aruba, the provisions of this note will also be applicable to the Netherlands
Antilles and Aruba.</al>

States of America, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the honour to propose
that this note and the Embassy's note in reply shall constitute an understanding
between the two Governments.</al>
          <al>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of this opportunity to reaffirm
to the Embassy the assurances of its sentiments of the highest esteem.</al>
