The Netherlands Government has given its consent for exempting the personnel of the Hague Conference by letter of 1 March 1967.</al><al>This exemption will be maintained after the agreement constituted by this exchange of notes on immunities and privileges (with the text of Point III of the Annex) between the Netherlands and the Hague Conference has entered into force, notwithstanding the developments that have taken place in the Netherlands schemes ever since.</al><al>The present Pension scheme rules of the Hague Conference, that entered into force on 1 June 1981, will also be deemed to offer comparable coverage.</al><al>As was discussed on 6 October 1992 between you and representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Social Affairs and Employment, there is one point of concern on the matter for the Netherlands Government: the health insurance, i.e. the insurance for medical etc. care (benefits in kind) offered by the Hague Conference, does not contain the benefits covered under the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (AWBZ), such as long term-hospitalization.</al><al>It is advised to provide for supplementary insurance for your personnel in this respect.</al><al>Please, Mr Secretary-General, accept the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.</al><al>(sd.)
