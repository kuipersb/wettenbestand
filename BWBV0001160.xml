							<al>The Parties to this Agreement,</al>
							<al>Recognizing that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavour should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and effective demand, and expanding the production of and trade in goods and services, while allowing for the optimal use of the world's resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development,</al>
							<al>Recognizing further that there is need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries, and especially the least developed among them, secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development,</al>
							<al>Being desirous of contributing to these objectives by entering into reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international trade relations,
							</al>
							<al>Resolved, therefore, to develop an integrated, more viable and durable multilateral trading system encompassing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the results of past trade liberalization efforts, and all of the results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations,</al>
							<al>Determined to preserve the basic principles and to further the objectives underlying this multilateral trading system,</al>

							<al>Members confirm their commitment to give preference to those measures which have the least disruptive effect on trade. Such measures (referred to in this Understanding as "price-based measures") shall be understood to include import surcharges, import deposit requirements or other equivalent trade measures with an impact on the price of imported goods. It is understood that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article II, price-based measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes may be applied by a Member in excess of the duties inscribed in the Schedule of that Member. Furthermore, that Member shall indicate the amount by which the price-based measure exceeds the bound duty clearly and separately under the notification procedures of this Understanding.</al>

In those cases in which a Member applies quantitative restrictions, it shall provide justification as to the reasons why price-based measures are not an adequate instrument to deal with the balance-of-payments situation. A Member maintaining quantitative restrictions shall indicate in successive consultations the progress made in significantly reducing the incidence and restrictive effect of such measures. It is understood that not more than one type of restrictive import measure taken for balance-of-payments purposes may be applied on the same product.</al>

							<al>Members  confirm   that   restrictive   import  measures   taken   for balance-of-payments purposes may only be applied to control the general level of imports and may not exceed what is necessary to address the balance-of-payments situation. In order to minimize any incidental protective effects, a Member shall administer restrictions in a transparent manner. The authorities of the importing Member shall provide adequate justification as to the criteria used to determine which products are subject to restriction. As provided in paragraph 3 of Article XII and paragraph 10 of Article XVIII, Members may, in the case of certain essential products, exclude or limit the application of surcharges applied across the board or other measures applied for balance-of-payments purposes. The term "essential products" shall be understood to mean products which meet basic consumption needs or which contribute to the Member's effort to improve its balance-of-payments situation, such as capital goods or inputs needed for production. In the administration of quantitative restrictions, a Member shall use discretionary licensing only when unavoidable and shall phase it out progressively. Appropriate justification shall be provided as to the criteria used to determine allowable import quantities or values.</al>

							<al>Members,</al>
							<al>Having regard to the provisions of Article XXIV of GATT 1994;</al>
							<al>Recognizing that customs unions and free trade areas have greatly increased in number and importance since the establishment of GATT 1947 and today cover a significant proportion of world trade;</al>
							<al>Recognizing the contribution to the expansion of world trade that may be made by closer integration between the economies of the parties to such agreements;</al>
							<al>Recognizing also that such contribution is increased if the elimination between the constituent territories of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce extends to all trade, and diminished if any major sector of trade is excluded;</al>
							<al>Reaffirming that the purpose of such agreements should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other Members with such territories; and that in their formation or enlargement the parties to them should to the greatest possible extent avoid creating adverse effects on the trade of other Members;</al>
							<al>Convinced also of the need to reinforce the effectiveness of the role of the Council for Trade in Goods in reviewing agreements notified under Article XXIV, by clarifying the criteria and procedures for the assessment of new or enlarged agreements, and improving the transparency of all Article XXIV agreements;</al>
							<al>Recognizing the need for a common understanding of the obligations of Members under paragraph 12 of Article XXIV;</al>

							<al>The evaluation under paragraph 5(a) of Article XXIV of the general incidence of the duties and other regulations of commerce applicable before and after the formation of a customs union shall in respect of duties and charges be based upon an overall assessment of weighted average tariff rates and of customs duties collected. This assessment shall be based on import statistics for a previous representative period to be supplied by the customs union, on a tariff-line basis and in values and quantities, broken down by WTO country of origin. The Secretariat shall compute the weighted average tariff rates and customs duties collected in accordance with the methodology used in the assessment of tariff offers in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. For this purpose, the duties and charges to be taken into consideration shall be the applied rates of duty. It is recognized that for the purpose of the overall assessment of the incidence of other regulations of commerce for which quantification and aggregation are difficult, the examination of individual measures, regulations, products covered and trade flows affected may be required.</al>

In this regard Members reaffirm that the procedure set forth in Article XXVIII, as elaborated in the guidelines adopted on 10 November 1980 (BISD 27S/26-28) and in the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXVIII of GATT 1994, must be commenced before tariff concessions are modified or withdrawn upon the formation of a customs union or an interim agreement leading to the formation of a customs union.</al>

							<al>These negotiations will be entered into in good faith with a view to achieving mutually satisfactory compensatory adjustment. In such negotiations, as required by paragraph 6 of Article XXIV, due account shall be taken of reductions of duties on the same tariff line made by other constituents of the customs union upon its formation. Should such reductions not be sufficient to provide the necessary compensatory adjustment, the customs union would offer compensation, which may take the form of reductions of duties on other tariff lines. Such an offer shall be taken into consideration by the Members having negotiating rights in the binding being modified or withdrawn. Should the compensatory adjustment remain unacceptable, negotiations should be continued. Where, despite such efforts, agreement in negotiations on compensatory adjustment under Article XXVIII as elaborated by the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXVIII of GATT 1994 cannot be reached within a reasonable period from the initiation of negotiations, the customs union shall, nevertheless, be free to modify or withdraw the concessions; affected Members shall then be free to withdraw substantially equivalent concessions in accordance with Article XXVIII.</al>

							<al>Members,</al>
							<al>Having decided to establish a basis for initiating a process of reform of trade in agriculture in line with the objectives of the negotiations as set out in the Punta del Este Declaration;</al>
							<al>Recalling that their long-term objective as agreed at the Mid-Term Review of the Uruguay Round "is to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system and that a reform process should be initiated through the negotiation of commitments on support and protection and through the establishment of strengthened and more operationally effective GATT rules and disciplines";</al>
							<al>Recalling further that "the above-mentioned long-term objective is to provide for substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection sustained over an agreed period of time, resulting in correcting and preventing restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets";</al>
							<al>Committed to achieving specific binding commitments in each of the following areas: market access; domestic support; export competition; and to reaching an agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary issues;</al>
							<al>Having agreed that in implementing their commitments on market access, developed country Members would take fully into account the particular needs and conditions of developing country Members by providing for a greater improvement of opportunities and terms of access for agricultural products of particular interest to these Members, including the fullest liberalization of trade in tropical agricultural products as agreed at the Mid-Term Review, and for products of particular importance to the diversification of production from the growing of illicit narcotic crops;</al>
							<al>Noting that commitments under the reform programme should be made in an equitable way among all Members, having regard to non-trade concerns, including food security and the need to protect the environment; having regard to the agreement that special and differential treatment for developing countries is an integral element of the negotiations, and taking into account the possible negative effects of the implementation of the reform programme on least-developed and net food-importing developing countries;</al>
							<al>Hereby agree as follows:</al>

								<al>The Committee shall encourage and facilitate ad hoc consultations or negotiations among Members on specific sanitary or phytosanitary issues. The Committee shall encourage the use of international standards, guidelines or recommendations by all Members and, in this regard, shall sponsor technical consultation and study with the objective of increasing coordination and integration between international and national systems and approaches for approving the use of food additives or for establishing tolerances for contaminants in foods, beverages or feedstuffs.</al>
							</lid>

								<lidnr status="officieel">3</lidnr>
								<al>The Committee shall maintain close contact with the relevant international organizations in the field of sanitary and phytosanitary protection, especially with the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, and the Secretariat of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0003652" compleet="nee">International Plant Protection Convention</extref>, with the objective of securing the best available scientific and technical advice for the administration of this Agreement and in order to ensure that unnecessary duplication of effort is avoided.</al>

								<al>The Committee shall develop a procedure to monitor the process of international harmonization and the use of international standards, guidelines or recommendations. For this purpose, the Committee should, in conjunction with the relevant international organizations, establish a list of international standards, guidelines or recommendations relating to sanitary or phytosanitary measures which the Committee determines to have a major trade impact. The list should include an indication by Members of those international standards, guidelines or recommendations which they apply as conditions for import or on the basis of which imported products conforming to these standards can enjoy access to their markets. For those cases in which a Member does not apply an international standard, guideline or recommendation as a condition for import, the Member should provide an indication of the reason therefor, and, in particular, whether it considers that the standard is not stringent enough to provide the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection. If a Member revises its position, following its indication of the use of a standard, guideline or recommendation as a condition for import, it should provide an explanation for its change and so inform the Secretariat as well as the relevant international organizations, unless such notification and explanation is given according to the procedures of Annex B.</al>

Members agree to cooperate fully, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, in instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention of this Agreement, to establish the relevant facts in the places of import, export and, where applicable, transshipment. It is agreed that such cooperation, consistent with domestic laws and procedures, will include: investigation of circumvention practices which increase restrained exports to the Member maintaining such restraints; exchange of documents, correspondence, reports and other relevant information to the extent available; and facilitation of plant visits and contacts, upon request and on a case-by-case basis.

Such action may include the denial of entry of goods or, where goods have entered, having due regard to the actual circumstances and the involvement of the country or place of true origin, the adjustment of charges to restraint levels to reflect the true country or place of origin. Also, where there is evidence of the involvement of the territories of the Members through which the goods have been transshipped, such action may include the introduction of restraints with respect to such Members. Any such actions, together with their timing and scope, may be taken after consultations held with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution between the concerned Members and shall be notified to the TMB with full justification. The Members concerned may agree on other remedies in consultation.

Should any Member believe that this Agreement is being circumvented by such false declaration and that no, or inadequate, administrative measures are being applied to address and/or to take action against such circumvention, that Member should consult promptly with the Member involved with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. If such a solution is not reached, the matter may be referred by any Member involved to the TMB for recommendations. This provision is not intended to prevent Members from making technical adjustments when inadvertent errors in declarations have been made.</al>

The request for consultations shall be accompanied by specific and relevant factual information, as up-to-date as possible, particularly in regard to: <nadruk type="cur">(a)</nadruk> the factors, referred to in paragraph 3, on which the Member invoking the action has based its determination of the existence of serious damage or actual threat thereof; and <nadruk type="cur">(b)</nadruk> the factors, referred to in paragraph 4, on the basis of which it proposes to invoke the safeguard action with respect to the Member or Members concerned. In respect of requests made under this paragraph, the information shall be related, as closely as possible, to identifiable segments of production and to the reference period set out in paragraph 8. The Member invoking the action shall also indicate the specific level at which imports of' the product in question from the Member or Members concerned arc proposed to be restrained; such level shall not be lower than the level referred to in paragraph 8. The Member seeking consultations shall, at the same time, communicate to the Chairman of the TMB the request for consultations, including all the relevant factual data outlined in paragraphs 3 and 4, together with the proposed restraint level. The Chairman shall inform the members of the TMB of the request for consultations, indicating the requesting Member, the product in question and the Member having received the request. The Member or Members concerned shall respond to this request promptly and the consultations shall be held without delay and normally be completed within 60 days of the date on which the request was received.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">8</lidnr>
								<al>If, in the consultations, there is mutual understanding that the situation calls for restraint on the exports of the particular product from the Member or Members concerned, the level of such restraint shall be fixed at a level not lower than the actual level of exports or imports from the Member concerned during the 12-month period terminating two months preceding the month in which the request for consultation was made.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">9</lidnr>
								<al>Details of the agreed restraint measure shall be communicated to the TMB within 60 days from the date of conclusion of the agreement. The TMB shall determine whether the agreement is justified in accordance with the provisions of this Article. In order to make its determination, the TMB shall have available to it the factual data provided to the Chairman of the TMB, referred to in paragraph 7, as well as any other relevant information provided by the Members concerned. The TMB may make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the Members concerned.</al>

								<al>If, however, after the expiry of the period of 60 days from the date on which the request for consultations was received, there has been no agreement between the Members, the Member which proposed to take safeguard action may apply the restraint by date of import or date of export, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, within 30 days following the 60-day period for consultations, and at the same time refer the matter to the TMB. It shall be open to either Member to refer the matter to the TMB before the expiry of the period of 60 days. In either case, the TMB shall promptly conduct an examination of the matter, including the determination of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, and its causes, and make appropriate recommendations to the Members concerned within 30 days. In order to conduct such examination, the TMB shall have available to it the factual data provided to the Chairman of the TMB, referred to in paragraph 7, as well as any other relevant information provided by the Members concerned.</al>

								<al>In highly unusual and critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, action under paragraph 10 may be taken provisionally on the condition that the request for consultations and notification to the TMB shall be effected within no more than five working days after taking the action. In the case that consultations do not produce agreement, the TMB shall be notified at the conclusion of consultations, but in any case no later than 60 days from the date of the implementation of the action. The TMB shall promptly conduct an examination of the matter, and make appropriate recommendations to the Members concerned within 30 days. In the case that consultations do produce agreement, Members shall notify the TMB upon conclusion but, in any case, no later than 90 days from the date of the implementation of the action. The TMB may make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the Members concerned.</al>

								<al>Should the restraint measure remain in force for a period exceeding one year, the level for subsequent years shall be the level specified for the first year increased by a growth rate of not less than 6 per cent per annum, unless otherwise justified to the TMB. The restraint level for the product concerned may be exceeded in either year of any two subsequent years by carry forward and/or carryover of 10 per cent of which carry forward shall not represent more than 5 per cent. No quantitative limits shall be placed on the combined use of carryover, carry forward and the provision of paragraph 14.</al>

								<al>In order to supervise the implementation of this Agreement, to examine all measures taken under this Agreement and their conformity therewith, and to take the actions specifically required of it by this Agreement, the Textiles Monitoring Body ("TMB") is hereby established. The TMB shall consist of a Chairman and 10 members. Its membership shall be balanced and broadly representative of the Members and shall provide for rotation of its members at appropriate intervals. The members shall be appointed by Members designated by the Council for Trade in Goods to serve on the TMB, discharging their function on an <nadruk type="cur">ad personam</nadruk> basis.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">2</lidnr>
								<al>The TMB shall develop its own working procedures. It is understood, however, that consensus within the TMB does not require the assent or concurrence of members appointed by Members involved in an unresolved issue under review by the TMB.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">3</lidnr>
								<al>The TMB shall be considered as a standing body and shall meet as necessary to carry out the functions required of it under this Agreement. It shall rely on notifications and information supplied by the Members under the relevant Articles of this Agreement, supplemented by any additional information or necessary details they may submit or it may decide to seek from them. It may also rely on notifications to and reports from other WTO bodies and from such other sources as it may deem appropriate.</al>
							</lid>

								<al>Members shall afford to each other adequate opportunity for consultations with respect to any matters affecting the operation of this Agreement.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">5</lidnr>
								<al>In the absence of any mutually agreed solution in the bilateral consultations provided for in this Agreement, the TMB shall, at the request of either Member, and following a thorough and prompt consideration of the matter, make recommendations to the Members concerned.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">6</lidnr>
								<al>At the request of any Member, the TMB shall review promptly any particular matter which that Member considers to be detrimental to its interests under this Agreement and where consultations between it and the Member or Members concerned have failed to produce a mutually satisfactory solution. On such matters, the TMB may make such observations as it deems appropriate to the Members concerned and for the purposes of the review provided for in paragraph 11.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">7</lidnr>
								<al>Before formulating its recommendations or observations, the TMB shall invite participation of such Members as may be directly affected by the matter in question.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">8</lidnr>
								<al>Whenever the TMB is called upon to make recommendations or findings, it shall do so, preferably within a period of 30 days, unless a different time period is specified in this Agreement. All such recommendations or findings shall be communicated to the Members directly concerned. All such recommendations or findings shall also be communicated to the Council for Trade in Goods for its information.</al>
							</lid>

								<lidnr status="officieel">9</lidnr>
								<al>The Members shall endeavour to accept in full the recommendations of the TMB, which shall exercise proper surveillance of the implementation of such recommendations.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">10</lidnr>
								<al>If a Member considers itself unable to conform with the recommendations of the TMB, it shall provide the TMB with the reasons therefor not later than one month after receipt of such recommendations. Following thorough consideration of the reasons given, the TMB shall issue any further recommendations it considers appropriate forthwith. If, after such further recommendations, the matter remains unresolved, either Member may bring the matter before the Dispute Settlement Body and invoke paragraph 2 of Article XXIII of GATT 1994 and the relevant provisions of the Dispute Settlement Understanding.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">11</lidnr>
								<al>In order to oversee the implementation of this Agreement, the Council for Trade in Goods shall conduct a major review before the end of each stage of the integration process. To assist in this review, the TMB shall, at least five months before the end of each stage, transmit to the Council for Trade in Goods a comprehensive report on the implementation of this Agreement during the stage under review, in particular in matters with regard to the integration process, the application of the transitional safeguard mechanism, and relating to the application of GATT 1994 rules and disciplines as defined in Articles 2, 3, 6 and 7 respectively. The TMB's comprehensive report may include any recommendation as deemed appropriate by the TMB to the Council for Trade in Goods.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">12</lidnr>
								<al>In the light of its review the Council for Trade in Goods shall by consensus take such decisions as it deems appropriate to ensure that the balance of rights and obligations embodied in this Agreement is not being impaired. For the resolution of any disputes that may arise with respect to matters referred to in Article 7, the Dispute Settlement Body may authorize, without prejudice to the final date set out under Article 9, an adjustment to paragraph 14 of Article 2, for the stage subsequent to the review, with respect to any Member found not to be complying with its obligations under this Agreement.</al>

							<al>Members,</al>
							<al>Having regard to the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations;</al>
							<al>Desiring to further the objectives of GATT 1994;</al>
							<al>Recognizing the important contribution that international standards and conformity assessment systems can make in this regard by improving efficiency of production and facilitating the conduct of international trade;</al>
							<al>Desiring therefore to encourage the development of such international standards and conformity assessment systems;</al>
							<al>Desiring however to ensure that technical regulations and standards, including packaging, marking and labelling requirements, and procedures for assessment of conformity with technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade;</al>
							<al>Recognizing that no country should be prevented from taking measures necessary to ensure the quality of its exports, or for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, of the environment, or for the prevention of deceptive practices, at the levels it considers appropriate, subject to the requirement that they are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on international trade, and are otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;</al>
							<al>Recognizing that no country should be prevented from taking measures necessary for the protection of its essential security interest;</al>
							<al>Recognizing the contribution which international standardization can make to the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries;</al>
							<al>Recognizing that developing countries may encounter special difficulties in the formulation and application of technical regulations and standards and procedures for assessment of conformity with technical regulations and standards, and desiring to assist them in their endeavours in this regard;</al>

With regard to the effect of the dumped imports on prices, the investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the dumped imports as compared with the price of a like product of the importing Member, or whether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.

							<al>The authorities may also request that an interested party provide its response in a particular medium (e.g. computer tape) or computer language. Where such a request is made, the authorities should consider the reasonable ability of the interested party to respond in the preferred medium or computer language, and should not request the party to use for its response a computer system other than that used by the party. The authority should not maintain a request for a computerized response if the interested party does not maintain computerized accounts and if presenting the response as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested party, e.g. it would entail unreasonable additional cost and trouble.

							<al>If the authorities have to base their findings, including those with respect to normal value, on information from a secondary source, including the information supplied in the application for the initiation of the investigation, they should do so with special circumspection. In such cases, the authorities should, where practicable, check the information from other independent sources at their disposal, such as published price lists, official import statistics and customs returns, and from the information obtained from other interested parties during the investigation. It is clear, however, that if an interested party does not cooperate and thus relevant information is being withheld from the authorities, this situation could lead to a result which is less favourable to the party than if the party did cooperate.</al>

									<li.nr>1.</li.nr>
									<al>The primary basis for customs value under this Agreement is "transaction value" as defined in Article 1. Article 1 is to be read together with Article 8 which provides, <nadruk type="cur">inter alia,</nadruk> for adjustments to the price actually paid or payable in cases where certain specific elements which are considered to form a part of the value for customs purposes are incurred by the buyer but are not included in the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods. Article 8 also provides for the inclusion in the transaction value of certain considerations which may pass from the buyer to the seller in the form of specified goods or services rather than in the form of money. Articles 2 through 7 provide methods of determining the customs value whenever it cannot be determined under the provisions of Article 1.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>Where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of Article 1 there should normally be a process of consultation between the customs administration and importer with a view to arriving at a basis of value under the provisions of Article 2 or 3. It may occur, for example, that the importer has information about the customs value of identical or similar imported goods which is not immediately available to the customs administration in the port of importation. On the other hand, the customs administration may have information about the customs value of identical or similar imported goods which is not readily available to the importer. A process of consultation between the two parties will enable information to be exchanged, subject to the requirements of commercial confidentiality, with a view to determining a proper basis of value for customs purposes.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>3.</li.nr>
									<al>Articles 5 and 6 provide two bases for determining the customs value where it cannot be determined on the basis of the transaction value of the imported goods or of identical or similar imported goods. Under paragraph 1 of Article 5 the customs value is determined on the basis of the price at which the goods are sold in the condition as imported to an unrelated buyer in the country of importation. The importer also has the right to have goods which are further processed after importation valued under the provisions of Article 5 if the importer so requests. Under Article 6 the customs value is determined on the basis of the computed value. Both these methods present certain difficulties and because of this the importer is given the right, under the provisions of Article 4, to choose the order of application of the two methods.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>4.</li.nr>
									<al>Article 7 sets out how to determine the customs value in cases where it cannot be determined under the provisions of any of the preceding Articles.</al>

									<al>Articles 1 through 7 define how the customs value of imported goods is to be determined under the provisions of this Agreement. The methods of valuation are set out in a sequential order of application. The primary method for customs valuation is defined in Article 1 and imported goods are to be valued in accordance with the provisions of this Article whenever the conditions prescribed therein are fulfilled.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>Where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of Article 1, it is to be determined by proceeding sequentially through the succeeding Articles to the first such Article under which the customs value can be determined.

									<al>If the importer does not request that the order of Articles 5 and 6 be reversed, the normal order of the sequence is to be followed.

									<al>"Generally accepted accounting principles" refers to the recognized consensus or substantial authoritative support within a country at a particular time as to which economic resources and obligations should be recorded as assets and liabilities, which changes in assets and liabilities should be recorded, how the assets and liabilities and changes in them should be measured, what information should be disclosed and how it should be disclosed, and which financial statements should be prepared.

On the other hand, the determination of usual profit and general expenses under the provisions of Article 6 would be carried out utilizing information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country of production. As a further example, the determination of an element provided for in paragraph l(b)(ii) of Article 8 undertaken in the country of importation would be carried out utilizing information in a manner consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles of that country.</al>

									<al>The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money. Payment may be made by way of letters of credit or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly. An example of an indirect payment would be the settlement by the buyer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller.</al>

									<al>Activities undertaken by the buyer on the buyer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in Article 8, are not considered to be an indirect payment to the seller, even though they might be regarded as of benefit to the seller.

Likewise, if the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities relating to the marketing of the imported goods, the value of these activities is not part of the customs value nor shall such activities result in rejection of the trans action value.</al>

									<al>Paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) provide different means of establishing the acceptability of a transaction value.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>Paragraph 2(a) provides that where the buyer and the seller are related, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the customs value provided that the relationship did not influence the price. It is not intended that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the buyer and the seller are related. Such examination will only be required where there are doubts about the acceptability of the price. Where the customs administration have no doubts about the acceptability of the price, it should be accepted without requesting further information from the importer. For example, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship, or it may already have detailed information concerning the buyer and the seller, and may already be satisfied from such examination or information that the relationship did not influence the price.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>3.</li.nr>
									<al>Where the customs administration is unable to accept the transaction value without further inquiry, it should give the importer an opportunity to supply such further detailed information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In this context, the customs administration should be prepared to examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price in question was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price. Where it can be shown that the buyer and seller, although related under the provisions of Article 15, buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced by the relationship. As an example of this, if the price had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who are not related to the seller, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced by the relationship. As a further example, where it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is representative of the firm's overall profit realized over a representative period of time (e.g. on an annual basis) in sales of goods of the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>4.</li.nr>
									<al>Paragraph 2b) provides an opportunity for the importer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates to a "test" value previously accepted by the customs administration and is therefore acceptable under the provisions of Article 1. Where a test under paragraph 2b) is met, it is not necessary to examine the question of influence under paragraph 2a). If the customs administration has already sufficient information to be satisfied, without further detailed inquiries, that one of the tests provided in paragraph 2b) has been met, there is no reason for it to require the importer to demonstrate that the test can be met. In paragraph 2b) the term "unrelated buyers" means buyers who are not related to the seller in any particular case.</al>

							</lijst></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><titel status="officieel">Paragraph 2b)</titel></kop><al>A number of factors must be taken into consideration in determining whether one value "closely approximates" to another value. These factors include the nature of the imported goods, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the goods are imported, and, whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply a uniform standard such as a fixed percentage, in each case. For example, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of goods could be unacceptable while a large difference in a case involving another type of goods might be acceptable in determining whether the transaction value closely approximates to the "test" values set forth in paragraph 2b) of Article 1.</al></divisie></divisie><divisie opmaak="default"><kop><titel status="officieel">Note to Article 2</titel></kop><lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet">

									<al>As a general rule, customs value is determined under this Agreement on the basis of information readily available in the country of importation. In order to determine a computed value, however, it may be necessary to examine the costs of producing the goods being valued and other information which has to be obtained from outside the country of importation. Furthermore, in most cases the producer of the goods will be outside the jurisdiction of the authorities of the country of importation. The use of the computed value method will generally be limited to those cases where the buyer and seller are related, and the producer is prepared to supply to the authorities of the country of importation the necessary costings and to provide facilities for any subsequent verification which may be necessary.</al>

It shall also include the value, apportioned as appropriate under the provisions of the relevant note to Article 8, of any element specified in paragraph 1b) of Article 8 which has been supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer for use in connection with the production of the imported goods. The value of the elements specified in paragraph lb)iv) of Article 8 which are undertaken in the country of importation shall be included only to the extent that such elements are charged to the producer. It is to be understood that no cost or value of the elements referred to in this paragraph shall be counted twice in determining the computed value.</al>

									<al>The "amount for profit and general expenses" referred to in paragraph 1b) of Article 6 is to be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer unless the producer's figures are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of importation.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>5.</li.nr>
									<al>It should be noted in this context that the "amount for profit and general expenses" has to be taken as a whole. It follows that if, in any particular case, the producer's profit figure is low and the producer's general expenses are high, the producer's profit and general expenses taken together may nevertheless be consistent with that usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind. Such a situation might occur, for example, if a product were being launched in the country of importation and the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the launch. Where the producer can demonstrate a low profit on sales of the imported goods because of particular commercial circumstances, the producer's actual profit figures should be taken into account provided that the producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and the producer's pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the branch of industry concerned. Such a situation might occur, for example, where producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or where they sell goods to complement a range of goods being produced in the country of importation and accept a low profit to maintain competitivity. Where the producer's own figures for profit and general expenses are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of importation, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based upon relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the goods.</al>

									<al>Where information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer is used for the purposes of determining a computed value, the authorities of the importing country shall inform the importer, if the latter so requests, of the source of such information, the data used and the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions of Article 10.</al>

									<al>There are two factors involved in the apportionment of the elements specified in paragraph lb)ii) of Article 8 to the imported goods - the value of the element itself and the way in which that value is to be apportioned to the imported goods. The apportionment of these elements should be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the circumstances and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>Concerning the value of the element, if the importer acquires the element from a seller not related to the importer at a given cost, the value of the element is that cost. If the element was produced by the importer or by a person related to the importer, its value would be the cost of producing it. If the element had been previously used by the importer, regardless of whether it had been acquired or produced by such importer, the original cost of acquisition or production would have to be adjusted downward to reflect its use in order to arrive at the value of the element.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>3.</li.nr>
									<al>Once a value has been determined for the element, it is necessary to apportion that value to the imported goods. Various possibilities exist. For example, the value might be apportioned to the first shipment if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire value at one time. As another example, the importer may request that the value be apportioned over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment. As a further example, the importer may request that the value be apportioned over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. The method of apportionment used will depend upon the documentation provided by the importer.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>4.</li.nr>
									<al>As an illustration of the above, an importer provides the producer with a mould to be used in the production of the imported goods and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival of the first shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. The importer may request the customs administration to apportion the value of the mould over 1,000 units, 4,000 units or 10,000 units.</al>

									<li.nr>1.</li.nr>
									<al>Additions for the elements specified in paragraph lb)iv) of Article 8 should be based on objective and quantifiable data. In order to minimize the burden for both the importer and customs administration in determining the values to be added, data readily available in the buyer's commercial record system should be used in so far as possible.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>For those elements supplied by the buyer which were purchased or leased by the buyer, the addition would be the cost of the purchase or the lease. No addition shall be made for those elements available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>3.</li.nr>
									<al>The ease with which it may be possible to calculate the values to be added will depend on a particular firm's structure and management practice, as well as its accounting methods.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>4.</li.nr>
									<al>For example, it is possible that a firm which imports a variety of products from several countries maintains the records of its design centre outside the country of importation in such a way as to show accurately the costs attributable to a given product. In such cases, a direct adjustment may appropriately be made under the provisions of Article 8.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>5.</li.nr>
									<al>In another case, a firm may carry the cost of the design centre outside the country of importation as a general overhead expense without allocation to specific products. In this instance, an appropriate adjustment could be made under the provisions of Article 8 with respect to the imported goods by apportioning total design centre costs over total production benefiting from the design centre and adding such apportioned cost on a unit basis to imports.</al>

							<lijst level="single" nr-sluiting="." start="1" type="expliciet">
								<li>
									<li.nr>1.</li.nr>
									<al>Where it is alleged that an indirect tax rebate scheme, or a drawback scheme, conveys a subsidy by reason of over-rebate or excess drawback of indirect taxes or import charges on inputs consumed in the production of the exported product, the investigating authorities should first determine whether the government of the exporting Member has in place and applies a system or procedure to confirm which inputs are consumed in the production of the exported product and in what amounts. Where such a system or procedure is determined to be applied, the investigating authorities should then examine the system or procedure to see whether it is reasonable, effective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted commercial practices in the country of export. The investigating authorities may deem it necessary to carry out, in accordance with paragraph 6 of Article 12, certain practical tests in order to verify information or to satisfy themselves that the system or procedure is being effectively applied.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>Where there is no such system or procedure, where it is not reasonable, or where it is instituted and considered reasonable but is found not to be applied or not to be applied effectively, a further examination by the exporting Member based on the actual inputs involved would need to be carried out in the context of determining whether an excess payment occurred. If the investigating authorities deemed it necessary, a further examination would be carried out in accordance with paragraph 1.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>3.</li.nr>
									<al>Investigating authorities should treat inputs as physically incorporated if such inputs are used in the production process and are physically present in the product exported. The Members note that an input need not be present in the final product in the same form in which it entered the production process.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>4.</li.nr>
									<al>In determining the amount of a particular input that is consumed in the production of the exported product, a "normal allowance for waste" should be taken into account, and such waste should be treated as consumed in the production of the exported product. The term "waste" refers to that portion of a given input  does not serve an independent function in the production process, is not consumed in the production of the exported product (for reasons such as inefficiencies) and is not recovered, used or sold by the same manufacturer.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>5.</li.nr>
									<al>The investigating authority's determination of whether the claimed allowance for waste is "normal" should take into account the production process, the average experience of the industry in the country of export, and other technical factors, as appropriate. The investigating authority should bear in mind that an important question is whether the authorities in the exporting Member have reasonably calculated the amount of waste, when such an amount is intended to be included in the tax or duty rebate or remission.</al>

									<al>Paragraph i) of the Illustrative List stipulates that home market inputs may be substituted for imported inputs in the production of a product for export provided such inputs are equal in quantity to, and have the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs being substituted. The existence of a verification system or procedure is important because it enables the government of the exporting Member to ensure and demonstrate that the quantity of inputs for which drawback is claimed does not exceed the quantity of similar products exported, in whatever form, and that there is not drawback of import charges in excess of those originally levied on the imported inputs in question.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>2.</li.nr>
									<al>Where it is alleged that a substitution drawback system conveys a subsidy, the investigating authorities should first proceed to determine whether the government of the exporting Member has in place and applies a verification system or procedure. Where such a system or procedure is determined to be applied, the investigating authorities should then examine the verification procedures to see whether they are reasonable, effective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted commercial practices in the country of export. To the extent that the procedures are determined to meet this test and are effectively applied, no subsidy should be presumed to exist. It may be deemed necessary by the investigating authorities to carry out, in accordance with paragraph 6 of Article 12, certain practical tests in order to verify information or to satisfy themselves that the verification procedures are being effectively applied.

								<li>
									<li.nr>3.</li.nr>
									<al>Where there are no verification procedures, where they are not reasonable, or where such procedures are instituted and considered reasonable but are found not to be actually applied or not applied effectively, there may be a subsidy.

If the investigating authorities deemed it necessary, a further examination would be carried out in accordance with paragraph 2.</al>

									<al>In pursuance of the objectives of this Agreement, Members shall enter into successive rounds of negotiations, beginning not later than five years from the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement and periodically thereafter, with a view to achieving a progressively higher level of liberalization. Such negotiations shall be directed to the reduction or elimination of the adverse effects on trade in services of measures as a means of providing effective market access.

									<al>The process of liberalization shall take place with due respect for national policy objectives and the level of development of individual Members, both overall and in individual sectors. There shall be appropriate flexibility for individual developing country Members for opening fewer sectors, liberalizing fewer types of transactions, progressively extending market access in line with their development situation and, when making access to their markets available to foreign service suppliers, attaching to such access conditions aimed at achieving the objectives referred to in Article IV.</al>

For the purposes of establishing such guidelines, the Council for Trade in Services shall carry out an assessment of trade in services in overall terms and on a sectoral basis with reference to the objectives of this Agreement, including those set out in paragraph 1 of Article IV. Negotiating guidelines shall establish modalities for the treatment of liberalization undertaken autonomously by Members since previous negotiations, as well as for the special treatment for least-developed country Members under the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article IV.</al>

									<lidnr status="officieel">4</lidnr>

								<al>The rules and procedures of this Understanding shall apply to dis putes brought pursuant to the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the agreements listed in Appendix 1 to this Understanding (referred to in this Understanding as the "covered agreements"). The rules and procedures of this Understanding shall also apply to consultations and the settlement of disputes between Members concerning their rights and obligations under the provisions of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (referred to in this Understanding as the "WTO Agreement") and of this Understanding taken in isolation or in combination with any other covered agreement.</al>

							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">2</lidnr>
								<al>The rules and procedures of this Understanding shall apply subject to such special or additional rules and procedures on dispute settlement contained in the covered agreements as are identified in Appendix 2 to this Understanding. To the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of this Understanding and the special or additional rules and procedures set forth in Appendix 2, the special or additional rules and procedures in Appendix 2 shall prevail. In disputes involving rules and procedures under more than one covered agreement, if there is a conflict between special or additional rules and procedures of such agreements under review, and where the parties to the dispute cannot agree on rules and procedures within 20 days of the establishment of the panel, the Chairman of the Dispute Settlement Body provided for in paragraph  1  of Article 2 (referred to in this Understanding as the "DSB"), in consultation with the parties to the dispute, shall determine the rules and procedures to be followed within 10 days after a request by either Member. The Chairman shall be guided by the principle that special or additional rules and procedures should be used where possible, and the rules and procedures set out in this Understanding should be used to the extent necessary to avoid conflict.</al>

								<al>The Dispute Settlement Body is hereby established to administer these rules and procedures and, except as otherwise provided in a covered agreement, the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements. Accordingly, the DSB shall have the authority to establish panels, adopt panel and Appellate Body reports, maintain surveillance of implementation of rulings and recommendations, and authorize suspension of concessions and other obligations under the covered agreements. With respect to disputes arising under a covered agreement which is a Plurilateral Trade Agreement, the term "Member" as used herein shall refer only to those Members that are parties to the relevant Plurilateral Trade Agreement.

								<al>Members affirm their adherence to the principles for the management of disputes heretofore applied under Articles XXII and XXIII of GATT 1947, and the rules and procedures as further elaborated and modified herein.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">2</lidnr>
								<al>The dispute settlement system of the WTO is a central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. The Members recognize that it serves to preserve the rights and obligations of Members under the covered agreements, and to clarify the existing provisions of those agreements in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law. Recommendations and rulings of the DSB cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in the covered agreements.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">3</lidnr>
								<al>The prompt settlement of situations in which a Member considers that any benefits accruing to it directly or indirectly under the covered agreements are being impaired by measures taken by another Member is essential to the effective functioning of the WTO and the maintenance of a proper balance between the rights and obligations of Members.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">4</lidnr>
								<al>Recommendations or rulings made by the DSB shall be aimed at achieving a satisfactory settlement of the matter in accordance with the rights and obligations under this Understanding and under the covered agreements.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">5</lidnr>
								<al>All solutions to matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements, including arbitration awards, shall be consistent with those agreements and shall not nullify or impair benefits accruing to any Member under those agreements, nor impede the attainment of any objective of those agreements.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">6</lidnr>
								<al>Mutually agreed solutions to matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements shall be notified to the DSB and the relevant Councils and Committees, where any Member may raise any point relating thereto.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">7</lidnr>
								<al>Before bringing a case, a Member shall exercise its judgement as to whether action under these procedures would be fruitful. The aim of the dispute settlement mechanism is to secure a positive solution to a dispute. A solution mutually acceptable to the parties to a dispute and consistent with the covered agreements is clearly to be preferred. In the absence of a mutually agreed solution, the first objective of the dispute settlement mechanism is usually to secure the withdrawal of the measures concerned if these are found to be inconsistent with the provisions of any of the covered agreements. The provision of compensation should be resorted to only if the immediate withdrawal of the measure is impracticable and as a temporary measure pending the withdrawal of the measure which is inconsistent with a covered agreement. The last resort which this Understanding provides to the Member invoking the dispute settlement procedures is the possibility of suspending the application of concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements on a discriminatory basis vis-&#xE0;-vis the other Member, subject to authorization by the DSB of such measures.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">8</lidnr>
								<al>In cases where there is an infringement of the obligations assumed  under a covered agreement, the action is considered <nadruk type="cur">prima facie  </nadruk>to constitute a case of nullification or impairment. This means that there is normally a presumption that a breach of the rules has an adverse impact on  other Members parties to that covered agreement, and in such cases, it  shall be up to the Member against whom the complaint has been brought  to rebut the charge. </al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">9</lidnr>
								<al>The provisions of this Understanding are without prejudice to the rights of Members to seek authoritative interpretation of provisions of a covered agreement through decision-making under the WTO Agreement or a covered agreement which is a Plurilateral Trade Agreement.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">10</lidnr>
								<al>It is understood that requests for conciliation and the use of the dispute settlement procedures should not be intended or considered as contentious acts and that, if a dispute arises, all Members will engage in these procedures in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute. It is also understood that complaints and counter-complaints in regard to distinct matters should not be linked.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">11</lidnr>
								<al>This Understanding shall be applied only with respect to new requests for consultations under the consultation provisions of the covered agreements made on or after the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement. With respect to disputes for which the request for consultations was made under GATT 1947 or under any other predecessor agreement to the covered agreements before the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement, the relevant dispute settlement rules and procedures in effect immediately prior to the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement shall continue to apply.<noot id="f176e2390994" type="voet">

								<al>Notwithstanding paragraph 11, if a complaint based on any of the covered agreements is brought by a developing country Member against a developed country Member, the complaining party shall have the right to invoke, as an alternative to the provisions contained in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 12 of this Understanding, the corresponding provisions of the Decision of 5 April 1966 (BISD 14S/18), except that where the Panel considers that the time-frame provided for in paragraph 7 of that Decision is insufficient to provide its report and with the agreement of the complaining party, that time-frame may be extended. To the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of Articles 4, 5, 6 and 12 and the corresponding rules and procedures of the Decision, the latter shall prevail.</al>

If the Member does not respond within 10 days after the date of receipt of the request, or does not enter into consultations within a period of no more than 30 days, or a period otherwise mutually agreed, after the date of receipt of the request, then the Member that requested the holding of consultations may proceed directly to request the establishment of a panel.</al>

								<lidnr status="officieel">2</lidnr>
								<al>Panel procedures should provide sufficient flexibility so as to ensure high-quality panel reports, while not unduly delaying the panel process.</al>
							</lid>

								<lidnr status="officieel">3</lidnr>
								<al>After consulting the parties to the dispute, the panelists shall, as soon as practicable and whenever possible within one week after the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon, fix the timetable for the panel process, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 9 of Article 4, if relevant.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">4</lidnr>
								<al>In determining the timetable for the panel process, the panel shall provide sufficient time for the parties to the dispute to prepare their submissions.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">5</lidnr>
								<al>Panels should set precise deadlines for written submissions by the parties and the parties should respect those deadlines.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">6</lidnr>
								<al>Each party to the dispute shall deposit its written submissions with the Secretariat for immediate transmission to the panel and to the other party or parties to the dispute. The complaining party shall submit its first submission in advance of the responding party's first submission unless the panel decides, in fixing the timetable referred to in paragraph 3 and after consultations with the parties to the dispute, that the parties should submit their first submissions simultaneously. When there are sequential arrangements for the deposit of first submissions, the panel shall establish a firm time-period for receipt of the responding party's submission. Any subsequent written submissions shall be submitted simultaneously.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">7</lidnr>
								<al>Where the parties to the dispute have failed to develop a mutually satisfactory solution, the panel shall submit its findings in the form of a written report to the DSB. In such cases, the report of a panel shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of relevant provisions and the basic rationale behind any findings and recommendations that it makes. Where a settlement of the matter among the parties to the dispute has been found, the report of the panel shall be confined to a brief description of the case and to reporting that a solution has been reached.</al>

							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">8</lidnr>
								<al>In order to make the procedures more efficient, the period in which the panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date the final report is issued to the parties to the dispute, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months. In cases of urgency, including those relating to perishable goods, the panel shall aim to issue its report to the parties to the dispute within three months.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">9</lidnr>
								<al>When the panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, or within three months in cases of urgency, it shall inform the DSB in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report. In no case should the period from the establishment of the panel to the circulation of the report to the Members exceed nine months.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">10</lidnr>
								<al>In the context of consultations involving a measure taken by a developing country Member, the parties may agree to extend the periods established in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Article 4. If, after the relevant period has elapsed, the consulting parties cannot agree that the consultations have concluded, the Chairman of the DSB shall decide, after consultation with the parties, whether to extend the relevant period and, if so, for how long. In addition, in examining a complaint against a developing country Member, the panel shall accord sufficient time for the developing country Member to prepare and present its argumentation. The provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 20 and paragraph 4 of Article 21 are not affected by any action pursuant to this paragraph.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">11</lidnr>
								<al>Where one or more of the parties is a developing country Member, the panel's report shall explicitly indicate the form in which account has been taken of relevant provisions on differential and more-favourable treatment for developing country Members that form part of the covered agreements which have been raised by the developing country Member in the course of the dispute settlement procedures.</al>
							</lid>
							<lid>
								<lidnr status="officieel">12</lidnr>
								<al>The panel may suspend its work at any time at the request of the complaining party for a period not to exceed 12 months. In the event of such a suspension, the time-frames set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Article, paragraph 1 of Article 20, and paragraph 4 of Article 21 shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If the work of the panel has been suspended for more than 12 months, the authority for establishment of the panel shall lapse.</al>

									<al>The purpose of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism ("TPRM") is to contribute to improved adherence by all Members to rules, disciplines and commitments made under the Multilateral Trade Agreements and, where applicable, the Plurilateral Trade Agreements, and hence to the smoother functioning of the multilateral trading system, by achieving greater transparency in, and understanding of, the trade policies and practices of Members. Accordingly, the review mechanism enables the regular collective appreciation and evaluation of the full range of individual Members' trade policies and practices and their impact on the functioning of the multilateral trading system. It is not, however, intended to serve as a basis for the enforcement of specific obligations under the Agreements or for dispute settlement procedures, or to impose new policy commitments on Members.</al>
								</li>
								<li>
									<li.nr>ii)</li.nr>
									<al>The assessment carried out under the review mechanism takes place, to the extent relevant, against the background of the wider economic and developmental needs, policies and objectives of the Member concerned, as well as of its external environment. However, the function of the review mechanism is to examine the impact of a Member's trade policies and practices on the multilateral trading system.</al>

									<al>The trade policies and practices of all Members shall be subject to periodic review. The impact of individual Members on the functioning of the multilateral trading system, defined in terms of their share of world trade in a recent representative period, will be the determining factor in deciding on the frequency of reviews. The first four trading entities so identified (counting the European Communities as one) shall be subject to review every two years. The next 16 shall be reviewed every four years. Other Members shall be reviewed every six years, except that a longer period may be fixed for least-developed country Members. It is understood that the review of entities having a common external policy covering more than one Member shall cover all components of policy affecting trade including relevant policies and practices of the individual Members. Exceptionally, in the event of changes in a Member's trade policies or practices that may have a significant impact on its trading partners, the Member concerned may be requested by the TPRB, after consultation, to bring forward its next review.</al>

							<al>In order to achieve the fullest possible degree of transparency, each Member shall report regularly to the TPRB. Full reports shall describe the trade policies and practices pursued by the Member or Members concerned, based on an agreed format to be decided upon by the TPRB. This format shall initially be based on the Outline Format for Country Reports established by the Decision of 19 July 1989 (BISD 36S/406-409), amended as necessary to extend the coverage of reports to all aspects of trade policies covered by the Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex 1 and, where applicable, the Plurilateral Trade Agreements. This format may be revised by the TPRB in the light of experience. Between reviews, Members shall provide brief reports when there are any significant changes in their trade policies; an annual update of statistical information will be provided according to the agreed format. Particular account shall be taken of difficulties presented to least-developed country Members in compiling their reports. The Secretariat shall make available technical assistance on request to developing country Members, and in particular to the least-developed country Members. Information contained in reports should to the greatest extent possible be coordinated with notifications made under provisions of the Multilateral Trade Agreements and, where applicable, the Plurilateral Trade Agreements.</al>

To this end, the Chairman of the TPRB shall, in consultation with the Member or Members concerned, and with the Chairman of the Committee on Balance-of-Payments Restrictions, devise administrative arrangements that harmonize the normal rhythm of the trade policy reviews with the timetable for balance-of-payments consultations but do not postpone the trade policy review by more than 12 months.</al>

							<al>Ministers recognize that the globalization of the world economy has led to ever-growing interactions between the economic policies pursued by individual countries, including interactions between the structural, macroeconomic, trade, financial and development aspects of economic policymaking. The task of achieving harmony between these policies falls primarily on governments at the national level, but their coherence internationally is an important and valuable element in increasing the effectiveness of these policies at national level. The Agreements reached in the Uruguay Round show that all the participating governments recognize the contribution that liberal trading policies can make to the healthy growth and development of their own economies and of the world economy as a whole.</al>

						<artikel status="goed">

								<nr status="officieel">2</nr>

							<al>Successful cooperation in each area of economic policy contributes to progress in other areas. Greater exchange rate stability, based on more orderly underlying economic and financial conditions, should contribute towards the expansion of trade, sustainable growth and development, and the correction of external imbalances. There is also a need for an adequate and timely flow of concessional and non-concessional financial and real investment resources to developing countries and for further efforts to address debt problems, to help ensure economic growth and development. Trade liberalization forms an increasingly important component in the success of the adjustment programmes that many countries are undertaking, often involving significant transitional social costs. In this connection, Ministers note the role of the World Bank and the IMF in supporting adjustment to trade liberalization, including support to net food-importing developing countries facing short-term costs arising from agricultural trade reforms.</al>

						<artikel status="goed">

								<nr status="officieel">3</nr>

							<al>The positive outcome of the Uruguay Round is a major contribution towards more coherent and complementary international economic policies. The results of the Uruguay Round ensure an expansion of market access to the benefit of all countries, as well as a framework of strengthened multilateral disciplines for trade. They also guarantee that trade policy will be conducted in a more transparent manner and with greater awareness of the benefits for domestic competitiveness of an open trading environment. The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round has the capacity to provide an improved forum for liberalization, to contribute to more effective surveillance, and to ensure strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines. These improvements mean that trade policy can in the future play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policymaking.</al>

							<al>Ministers recognize, however, that difficulties the origins of which lie outside the trade field cannot be redressed through measures taken in the trade field alone. This underscores the importance of efforts to improve other elements of global economic policymaking to complement the effective implementation of the results achieved in the Uruguay Round.</al>

							<al>The interlinkages between the different aspects of economic policy require that the international institutions with responsibilities in each of these areas follow consistent and mutually supportive policies. The World Trade Organization should therefore pursue and develop cooperation with the international organizations responsible for monetary and financial matters, while respecting the mandate, the confidentiality requirements and the necessary autonomy in decision-making procedures of each institution, and avoiding the imposition on governments of cross-conditionality  or additional conditions.   Ministers  further invite  the Director-General of the WTO to review with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and the President of the World Bank, the implications of the WTO's responsibilities for its cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the forms such cooperation might take, with a view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policymaking.</al>

To this end Ministers agree:</al>

Handelsovereenkomsten in Bijlage 1 op de werking waarvan zij toezien. Gedurende

2, 5 of 6 van toepassing zijn. Indien consensus is bereikt, legt de Ministeri&#xEB;le
Conferentie de voorgestelde wijziging onverwijld aan de Leden voor ter aanvaarding.

vergadering van de Ministeri&#xEB;le Conferentie, besluit de Ministeri&#xEB;le

op andere wijze, door de Partijen bij de GATT-Overeenkomst van 1947 en door
de Europese Gemeenschappen die gerechtigd zijn oorspronkelijke Leden van de
WTO te worden in overeenstemming met artikel XI van deze Overeenkomst. Deze

Handelsovereenkomsten. Deze Overeenkomst en de daaraan gehechte Multilaterale
Handelsovereenkomsten treden in werking op de datum door de Ministers bepaald
in overeenstemming met paragraaf 3 van de Slotakte waarin de resultaten van
de Uruguay-Ronde van de multilaterale handelsbesprekingen zijn neergelegd
en blijft voor aanvaarding openstaan voor een tijdvak van twee jaar na die
datum tenzij de Ministers anders besluiten. Aanvaarding na de inwerkingtreding
van deze Overeenkomst wordt van kracht op de dertigste dag na de nederlegging
van de akte van aanvaarding.</al>

van tijdschema's voor de opheffing van ter bescherming van de betalingsbalans
getroffen beperkende invoermaatregelen. Overeengekomen wordt dat dergelijke
tijdschema's zo nodig kunnen worden gewijzigd om rekening te houden met veranderingen
in de betalingsbalanssituatie. Telkens wanneer een tijdschema niet door een
Lid bekend wordt gemaakt, moet dat Lid de redenen waarom zulks niet geschiedde,
opgeven.</al></artikel><artikel><kop><nr>2</nr></kop><al> De Leden bevestigen hun verbintenis tot het geven van de voorkeur aan
die maatregelen die het handelsverkeer het minst verstoren. Dergelijke maatregelen

aanvullende heffingen bij invoer, borgstellingsverplichtingen of andere soortgelijke
handelsmaatregelen die van invloed zijn op de prijs van ingevoerde goederen.
Er wordt overeengekomen dat ter bescherming van de betalingsbalans genomen
op prijzen gebaseerde maatregelen, in afwijking van het bepaalde in artikel
II, door een Lid kunnen worden toegepast bovenop de in de Lijst van dat Lid
vermelde rechten. Voorts geeft dat Lid overeenkomstig de kennisgevingsprocedures

brengen. Voor de gevallen waarin een Lid kwantitatieve beperkingen toepast,
geeft het de redenen op waarom op prijzen gebaseerde maatregelen geen passend
instrument zijn om de betalingsbalanssituatie op te lossen. Een Lid dat kwantitatieve
beperkingen blijft opleggen, brengt bij successievelijk overleg verslag uit
over de voortgang geboekt met het aanmerkelijk verminderen van de gevolgen
en het beperkend effect van die maatregelen. Overeengekomen wordt dat hetzelfde

beperkende invoermaatregelen slechts mogen worden toegepast om het algemene
niveau van de invoer te regelen en niet meer mogen inhouden dan hetgeen in
verband met de betalingsbalanssituatie noodzakelijk is. Ten einde bijkomende
beschermende effecten tot een minimum te beperken, past een Lid de beperkingen
op doorzichtige wijze toe. De autoriteiten van het importerende Lid motiveren
de criteria op grond waarvan werd bepaald welke produkten aan beperkingen
worden onderworpen op passende wijze. Zoals in lid 3 van artikel XII en lid
10 van artikel XVIII bepaald, kunnen de Leden ingeval van bepaalde essenti&#xEB;le
produkten de toepassing van algemene aanvullende extra heffingen of andere
ter bescherming van de betalingsbalans genomen maatregelen uitsluiten of beperken.
Onder &#x201E;essenti&#xEB;le produkten&#x201D; worden verstaan produkten die beantwoorden
aan fundamentele verbruiksbehoeften of een bijdrage leveren aan de inspanningen
van het Lid ter verbetering van de betalingsbalanssituatie, zoals kapitaalgoederen
of voor produktie benodigde inputs. Bij het beheer van kwantitatieve beperkingen
maakt een Lid slechts gebruik van de toekenning van discretionaire vergunningen,
wanneer zulks onvermijdelijk is en deze worden geleidelijk opgeheven. De gebruikte
criteria ter vaststelling van toegestane invoerhoeveelheden of -waarden worden
op passende wijze gemotiveerd.</al></artikel></divisie><divisie><kop><titel>Procedures voor overleg over de betalingsbalans</titel></kop><artikel><kop><nr>5</nr></kop><al> De Commissie inzake beperkingen ten behoeve van de betalingsbalans

kan de Algemene Raad aanbevelen dat een Lid bij het naleven van dat tijdschema
wordt geacht te voldoen aan zijn verplichtingen uit hoofde van GATT 1994.
Wanneer de Algemene Raad specifieke aanbevelingen heeft gedaan, worden de
rechten en verplichtingen van Leden in het licht van die aanbevelingen beoordeeld.
Bij het ontbreken van specifieke voorstellen voor aanbevelingen van de Algemene
Raad moeten de verschillende in de Commissie naar voren gebrachte meningen
in de conclusies van de Commissie worden opgenomen. Wanneer er gebruik werd
gemaakt van de vereenvoudigde overlegprocedures dient het verslag een samenvatting
van de voornaamste in de Commissie besproken onderwerpen en een besluit over
de vraag of volledige overlegprocedures vereist zijn te omvatten.</al></artikel></divisie></vrije-tekst></verdragtekst><verdragtekst><kop>

en na de totstandbrenging van een douane-unie geldende rechten en andere handelsregelingen
wordt voor wat de rechten en heffingen betreft, gebaseerd op een globale beoordeling
van gewogen gemiddelde tarieven en ge&#xEF;nde douanerechten. Deze beoordeling
vindt plaats aan de hand van voor een voorgaande representatieve periode door
de douane-unie per tarieflijn, met vermelding van de waarde en het volume
en het WTO-land van oorsprong, te verstrekken invoerstatistieken. Het secretariaat
berekent de gewogen gemiddelde tarieven en ge&#xEF;nde douanerechten volgens
de methodologie die werd gebruikt bij de beoordeling van de tijdens de multilaterale
handelsbesprekingen in het kader van de Uruguay-Ronde gedane tariefaanbiedingen.
In dit verband zijn de rechten en heffingen waarmee rekening moet worden gehouden
de toegepaste rechten. Erkend wordt dat voor de globale beoordeling van andere
handelsregelingen die moeilijk zijn te kwantificeren en bij elkaar op te tellen
een onderzoek van de individuele maatregelen, regelingen, betrokken produkten
en handelsstromen vereist kan zijn.</al></artikel><artikel><kop><nr>3</nr></kop><al> De in lid 5, sub c. van artikel XXIV genoemde &#x201E;redelijke termijn&#x201D;

wanneer een Lid dat een douane-unie tot stand brengt, voornemens is een geconsolideerd

XXVIII uiteengezette procedure, zoals die wordt gepreciseerd in de op 10 november
1980 goedgekeurde richtsnoeren (BISD 27S/26-28) en in het Memorandum van Overeenstemming
betreffende de interpretatie van artikel XXVIII van GATT 1994, moet worden
aangevangen voordat er bij de totstandbrenging van een douane-unie of een
voorlopige overeenkomst leidende tot de totstandbrenging van een douane-unie
tariefconcessies worden gewijzigd of ingetrokken.</al></artikel><artikel><kop><nr>5</nr></kop><al> Deze onderhandelingen zullen te goeder trouw worden aangeknoopt met
het oog op het treffen van een over en weer bevredigende compenserende regeling.
Bij deze onderhandelingen wordt, zoals lid 6 van artikel XXIV vereist, naar
behoren rekening gehouden met de door andere samenstellende delen van de douane-unie
bij haar totstandbrenging uitgevoerde verlagingen van rechten op dezelfde
tarieflijn. Mochten dergelijke verlagingen onvoldoende zijn om te zorgen voor
de noodzakelijke compenserende correctie dan biedt de douane-unie compensatie
die de vorm van verlagingen van rechten op andere tarieflijnen kan aannemen.
Een dergelijk aanbod wordt in overweging genomen door de Leden die onderhandelingsrechten
hebben voor de consolidatie die wordt gewijzigd of ingetrokken. Mocht de compenserende
correctie nog steeds onaanvaardbaar zijn dan dienen de onderhandelingen te
worden voortgezet. Indien er ondanks deze inspanningen niet binnen een redelijke
termijn te rekenen vanaf het begin van de onderhandelingen overeenstemming
kan worden bereikt bij de onderhandelingen over compensaties in het kader
van artikel XXVIII, zoals gepreciseerd in het Memorandum van Overeenstemming
betreffende de interpretatie van artikel XXVIII van GATT '94, staat het de
douane-unie niettemin vrij de concessies te wijzigen of in te trekken; de
hierdoor getroffen Leden zijn dan overeenkomstig artikel XXVIII vrij om nagenoeg
gelijkwaardige concessies in te trekken.</al></artikel><artikel><kop><nr>6</nr></kop><al> GATT 1994 verplicht Leden die ingevolge de totstandbrenging van een

uitgevoerde opschortingen of intrekkingen vervallen vanaf de dag waarop de
lijst van het Lid dat voornaamste leverancier is een lijst bij GATT 1994 wordt.</al>

      <al>De Leden,</al>
                        <al>Besloten hebbende de grondslag te leggen voor een hervorming van de handel
in landbouwprodukten volgens de in de Verklaring van Punta del Este vermelde
onderhandelingsdoelstellingen;</al>
                        <al>Eraan herinnerend dat bij de Tussentijdse Evaluatie (Mid-Term Review-MTR)
van de Uruguay-Ronde een billijk en marktgeori&#xEB;nteerd handelssysteem
voor landbouwprodukten als doelstelling voor de lange termijn is overeengekomen
en dat via verbintenissen ten aanzien van ondersteuning en bescherming, alsmede
door vaststelling van aangescherpte en effici&#xEB;ntere GATT-regels en -disciplines
een hervormingsproces op gang moet worden gebracht;</al>
                        <al>Er voorts aan herinnerend dat bovengenoemde lange&#x2013;termijndoelstelling
ertoe moet leiden dat gedurende een overeengekomen periode de ondersteuning
en bescherming van de landbouw aanzienlijk en progressief wordt verlaagd,
zodat restricties en distorsies op de wereldmarkten voor landbouwprodukten
gecorrigeerd en voorkomen worden;</al>
                        <al>Vastbesloten om te komen tot specifieke verbintenissen ten aanzien van
markttoegang, interne steun en concurrentie op exportgebied, alsmede tot een
overeenkomst inzake sanitaire en fytosanitaire maatregelen;</al>
                        <al>Overeengekomen zijnde dat de Leden die ontwikkelde landen zijn bij de
uitvoering van hun verbintenissen inzake markttoegang ten volle rekening zullen
houden met de bijzondere behoeften en omstandigheden van Leden die ontwikkelingslanden
zijn, door grotere verbeteringen in de mogelijkheden en voorwaarden voor markttoegang
voor landbouwprodukten die van bijzonder belang zijn voor laatstgenoemde Leden,
waaronder &#x2013; zoals overeengekomen tijdens de MTR &#x2013; een zo groot
mogelijke vrijmaking van de handel in tropische landbouwprodukten, en ook
voor produkten die van bijzonder belang zijn in het kader van overschakeling
op de teelt van andere gewassen dan illegale gewassen voor de produktie van
drugs;</al>
                        <al>Erop wijzende dat de verbintenissen in het kader van het hervormingsprogramma
evenwichtig over alle Leden gespreid dienen te worden, rekening houdende met
andere doelstellingen dan die op handelsgebied, zoals de continu&#xEF;teit
in de voedselvoorziening en de noodzaak tot bescherming van het milieu, en
met de afspraak dat een bijzondere en afwijkende behandeling voor de ontwikkelingslanden
een integrerend deel is van de onderhandelingen, alsmede met de mogelijke
negatieve effecten van uitvoering van het hervormingsprogramma op de minstontwikkelde
landen en op de landen die netto-importeur van voedsel zijn,</al>

reeds zijn ingevoerd en gelet op de werkelijke omstandigheden en de betrokkenheid
van het land of de plaats van werkelijke oorsprong, een aanpassing van de

dat, wanneer blijkt dat dergelijke valse verklaringen zijn opgesteld met het
doel de regels te ontduiken, de nodige maatregelen tegen de betrokken exporteurs
of importeurs genomen dienen te worden, overeenkomstig de nationale wetten
en procedures. Mocht een Lid van oordeel zijn dat de regels van de Overeenkomst
door middel van dergelijke valse verklaringen worden ontdoken en dat geen

dat Lid terstond overleg plegen met het betrokken Lid om te trachten tot een

niet gevonden, dan kan de zaak door een betrokken Lid aan het OST voor een

veiligheid, het voorkomen van misleidende praktijken, de bescherming van de
gezondheid of de veiligheid van mensen en van het leven of de gezondheid van
dieren of planten of van het milieu. Bij het beoordelen van dergelijke risico's

tot de materie waarvoor zij normen heeft goedgekeurd of voornemens is dit
te doen. De deelneming van de op het grondgebied van een Lid gevestigde normalisatie-instellingen
aan een specifieke internationale normalisatie-activiteit geschiedt zoveel
mogelijk via een enkele delegatie die alle op dat grondgebied gevestigde normalisatie-instellingen

Voorts stellen zij alles in het werk om een nationale consensus te bereiken
over de normen die zij opstellen. De regionale normalisatie-instelling doet eveneens al het mogelijke om
doublures of overlappingen met de werkzaamheden van bevoegde internationale

het ogenblik waarop het besluit tot vaststelling daarvan is genomen tot het

met dumping die de binnenlandse bedrijfstak tegelijkertijd schade toebrengen

de invoer met dumping worden toegeschreven. Relevant in dit verband zijn,
onder andere, de hoeveelheden en de prijzen van importprodukten die niet tegen
dumpprijzen worden verkocht, een inkrimping van de vraag of wijzigingen in

onderzoek belaste autoriteiten nauwkeurig aan welke gegevens zij van belanghebbenden
wensen te ontvangen, evenals de wijze waarop belanghebbenden hun antwoorden
dienen te structureren. De autoriteiten zien er bovendien op toe dat belanghebbenden
ervan op de hoogte zijn dat, indien de informatie niet binnen een redelijke
termijn wordt verstrekt, zij hun vaststellingen kunnen doen op basis van de
beschikbare gegevens, met inbegrip van die welke door de binnenlandse bedrijfstak
in het verzoek tot opening van het onderzoek zijn verstrekt.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>2</nr></kop><al> De autoriteiten kunnen bovendien verlangen dat een belanghebbende zijn
antwoord op een bepaalde drager (bijvoorbeeld magneetband) of in een bepaalde
computertaal verstrekt. Wanneer een dergelijk verzoek wordt gedaan, gaan de
autoriteiten na of de belanghebbende redelijkerwijze in staat is zijn antwoorden
op de gevraagde drager of in de gevraagde computertaal te verstrekken en zij
verlangen niet dat deze voor het verstrekken van zijn antwoord een ander dan
zijn eigen computersysteem gebruikt. De autoriteiten eisen niet dat het antwoord
via de computer wordt verstrekt indien de belanghebbende niet over een geautomatiseerde
administratie beschikt en deze wijze van beantwoording van de gestelde vragen
een onredelijke extra belasting voor hem zou inhouden, met andere woorden,
indien dit onredelijke bijkomende kosten en moeilijkheden zou veroorzaken.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>3</nr></kop><al> Alle controleerbare informatie die zo wordt verstrekt dat zij zonder
grote moeilijkheden bij het onderzoek kan worden gebruikt, tijdig ter beschikking
wordt gesteld en, in voorkomend geval, op een door de autoriteiten gevraagde
drager of in een door de autoriteiten gevraagde computertaal wordt verstrekt,
dient bij de vaststellingen in aanmerking te worden genomen. Indien een partij
haar antwoord niet op de gewenste drager of in de gewenste computertaal verstrekt,
maar de autoriteiten constateren dat aan de in punt 2 gestelde voorwaarden
is voldaan, mag dit niet worden beschouwd het onderzoek aanmerkelijk te belemmeren.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>4</nr></kop><al> Wanneer de autoriteiten de op een bepaalde drager (bijvoorbeeld magneetband)

te verstrekken.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>6</nr></kop><al> Indien bewijsmateriaal of inlichtingen niet worden aanvaard, dient
de partij die deze heeft verstrekt onverwijld in kennis te worden gesteld

gelegenheid te worden gesteld binnen een redelijke termijn nadere inlichtingen
te verstrekken, waarbij rekening dient te worden gehouden met de termijnen
van het onderzoek. Indien de nadere inlichtingen door de autoriteiten ontoereikend
worden geacht, dienen de redenen voor de afwijzing van dergelijk bewijsmateriaal
of dergelijke informatie te worden vermeld in alle vaststellingen die openbaar
worden gemaakt.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>7</nr></kop><al> Indien de autoriteiten hun bevindingen, met inbegrip van die welke
betrekking hebben op de normale waarde, dienen te baseren op informatie die
zij uit secundaire bron hebben verkregen, met inbegrip van informatie die
in het verzoek tot opening van een onderzoek was opgenomen, dienen zij de
nodige voorzorgsmaatregelen in acht te nemen. In dergelijke gevallen dienen
de autoriteiten de verkregen informatie, indien mogelijk, te toetsen aan informatie
uit andere onafhankelijke bronnen waarover zij beschikken, zoals gepubliceerde
prijslijsten, offici&#xEB;le invoerstatistieken of douanestatistieken alsmede
aan de informatie die in de loop van het onderzoek van andere belanghebbenden
werd verkregen. Het spreekt echter vanzelf dat indien een belanghebbende geen
medewerking verleent en de autoriteiten derhalve bepaalde relevante informatie
wordt onthouden, dit ten gevolge kan hebben dat de resultaten voor deze belanghebbende
minder gunstig zijn dan indien hij zijn medewerking had verleend.</al></artikel></wettekst>

is de &#x201E;transactiewaarde" als omschreven in artikel 1. artikel 1 dient
te worden gelezen in samenhang met artikel 8, dat, onder meer, in een aanpassing
van de werkelijk betaalde of te betalen prijs voorziet in het geval dat bepaalde
specifieke elementen die worden geacht deel uit te maken van de douanewaarde
ten laste van de koper komen, maar niet in de werkelijk voor de in te voeren
goederen betaalde of te betalen prijs zijn begrepen. In artikel 8 is tevens
bepaald dat sommige prestaties van de koper ten gunste van de verkoper die
veeleer in de vorm van bepaalde goederen of diensten dan in de vorm van geld
worden verstrekt tot de transactiewaarde behoren. De artikelen 2 tot en met
7 hebben betrekking op de methoden voor het bepalen van de douanewaarde in
gevallen waarin deze waarde niet met toepassing van artikel 1 kan worden vastgesteld.</al></li><li><li.nr>2.</li.nr><al> Wanneer de douanewaarde niet overeenkomstig artikel 1 kan worden bepaald,
plegen de douanediensten en de importeur normaliter overleg om de grondslag
van de waarde overeenkomstig artikel 2 of artikel 3 vast te stellen. Het kan
bijvoorbeeld voorkomen dat de importeur over gegevens betreffende de douanewaarde
van ingevoerde identieke of soortgelijke goederen beschikt waarover de douanediensten
van de invoerhaven niet direct beschikken. Het is echter ook mogelijk dat
de douanediensten over inlichtingen betreffende de douanewaarde van ingevoerde
identieke of soortgelijke goederen beschikken die voor de importeur niet zonder
meer toegankelijk zijn. Door overleg tussen de partijen kunnen met inachtneming
van het handelsgeheim inlichtingen worden uitgewisseld teneinde een passende
grondslag voor de douanewaarde vast te stellen.</al></li><li><li.nr>3.</li.nr><al> De artikelen 5 en 6 verschaffen twee grondslagen voor het bepalen van
de douanewaarde in gevallen waarin deze niet op grond van de transactiewaarde
van de ingevoerde goederen of van ingevoerde identieke of soortgelijke goederen
kan worden vastgesteld. Krachtens artikel 5, lid 1 wordt de douanewaarde bepaald
op grond van de prijs waartegen de goederen in de staat waarin zij worden
ingevoerd aan een niet verbonden koper in het land van invoer worden verkocht.
Voorts heeft de importeur op zijn verzoek het recht de douanewaarde van goederen
die na de invoer aan een bewerking of verwerking worden onderworpen met toepassing
van artikel 5 te doen bepalen. Krachtens artikel 6 wordt de douanewaarde op
grond van de berekende waarde bepaald. Beide methoden doen evenwel bepaalde
moeilijkheden rijzen en om die reden geeft artikel 4 de importeur het recht
de volgorde te kiezen waarin beide methoden worden toegepast.</al></li><li><li.nr>4.</li.nr><al> In artikel 7 is aangegeven hoe de douanewaarde wordt bepaald in gevallen
waarin dit niet op basis van een van de voorafgaande artikelen kan geschieden.</al></li></lijst><al>De Leden,</al>

verstaan de boekhoudkundige beginselen waarvoor in een land op een bepaald

bepalen welke economische middelen en verplichtingen als activa en passiva
moeten worden geboekt, welke wijzigingen in de activa en passiva dienen te
worden geregistreerd, hoe de activa en passiva en de wijzigingen daarvan moeten
worden gemeten, welke gegevens openbaar moeten worden gemaakt en hoe deze
openbaarmaking dient te geschieden, alsmede welke financi&#xEB;le staten moeten
worden opgemaakt. Deze normen kunnen zowel globale richtlijnen van algemene
toepassing als gedetailleerde handelwijzen en procedures zijn.</al>

elk Lid gebruik van gegevens die zijn opgemaakt met inachtneming van de algemeen
aanvaarde boekhoudkundige beginselen van het land dat volgens het betrokken
artikel hiervoor in aanmerking komt. Zo zouden bijvoorbeeld voor het bepalen
van de normale winstmarge en de algemene kosten overeenkomstig artikel 5 gegevens
worden gebruikt die aan de algemeen aanvaarde boekhoudkundige beginselen van
het land van invoer beantwoorden. Voor het vaststellen van de gebruikelijke
winstmarge en de algemene kosten overeenkomstig artikel 6 zou daarentegen
informatie worden gebruikt die beantwoordt aan de algemeen aanvaarde boekhoudkundige
beginselen van het land waar de goederen zijn voortgebracht. Verder zal bijvoorbeeld
voor de vaststelling van een in artikel 8, lid 1 onder b., punt i. bedoeld
element in het land van invoer informatie worden gebruikt die aan de algemeen
aanvaarde boekhoudkundige beginselen van dat land beantwoordt.</al>

geen reden tot afwijzing van de transactiewaarde uit hoofde van artikel 1.
Indien de koper voor eigen rekening activiteiten verricht die verband houden
met de verkoop van de ingevoerde goederen, zelfs indien dit ingevolge een
overeenkomst met de verkoper geschiedt, dan maakt de waarde van deze activiteiten
evenmin deel uit van de douanewaarde en vormen deze activiteiten evenmin een

                           <al> In lid 2, onder a. is bepaald dat indien de koper en de verkoper verbonden
zijn, de omstandigheden van de verkoop moeten worden onderzocht en de transactiewaarde
als douanewaarde wordt aanvaard indien de verbondenheid de prijs niet heeft
be&#xEF;nvloed. Het is niet de bedoeling dat de omstandigheden worden onderzocht
in alle gevallen waarin de koper en de verkoper verbonden zijn. Een dergelijk
onderzoek is enkel vereist wanneer er twijfel bestaat over de aanvaardbaarheid
van de prijs. Indien de douane geen twijfels heeft omtrent de aanvaardbaarheid
van de prijs, wordt deze aanvaard zonder dat de importeur om aanvullende gegevens
wordt verzocht. Het is bijvoorbeeld mogelijk dat de douane de verbondenheid
eerder heeft onderzocht of over gedetailleerde gegevens betreffende de koper
en verkoper beschikt en zij uit dit onderzoek of deze gegevens reeds heeft
geconcludeerd dat de verbondenheid de prijs niet heeft be&#xEF;nvloed. </al>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                           <al> Indien de douane de transactiewaarde niet zonder verder onderzoek kan
aanvaarden, geeft zij de importeur de gelegenheid aanvullende gegevens te
verstrekken, die zij nodig kan hebben om de omstandigheden van de verkoop
te onderzoeken. In dit verband moet de douane, om te kunnen beoordelen of
de verbondenheid de prijs heeft be&#xEF;nvloed, bereid zijn de relevante aspecten
van de transactie te onderzoeken, met inbegrip van de wijze waarop de koper
en de verkoper hun handelsbetrekkingen organiseren en de wijze waarop de desbetreffende
prijs tot stand is gekomen. Indien kan worden aangetoond dat de koper en de
verkoper, hoewel verbonden in de zin van artikel 15, van elkaar kopen en aan
elkaar verkopen alsof zij niet verbonden waren, dan mag worden aangenomen
dat de verbondenheid de prijs niet heeft be&#xEF;nvloed. Indien bijvoorbeeld
de prijs volgens de normale prijsstellingsmethoden van de betrokken bedrijfstak
tot stand is gekomen of volgens de methode die de verkoper voor het vaststellen
van zijn prijzen ten aanzien van niet met hun verbonden verkopers hanteert,
dan mag worden aangenomen dat de verbondenheid de prijs niet heeft be&#xEF;nvloed.
Zo mag bijvoorbeeld ook worden aangenomen dat de prijs niet is be&#xEF;nvloed
indien wordt aangetoond dat deze kostendekkend is en een winstmarge omvat
die representatief is voor de globale winstmarge van de betrokken onderneming
over een representatieve periode (bijvoorbeeld op jaarbasis) bij de verkoop
van goederen van dezelfde categorie of soort.</al>

                           <al> Lid 2, onder b. biedt de importeur de mogelijkheid aan te tonen dat
de transactiewaarde een eerder door de douane aanvaarde referentiewaarde zeer
dicht benadert en dat de prijs derhalve aanvaardbaar is voor de toepassing
van artikel 1. Wanneer aan &#xE9;&#xE9;n van de in lid 2, onder b. genoemde
criteria is voldaan, behoeft de be&#xEF;nvloeding van de prijs als bedoeld
onder a. van dit lid niet meer te worden onderzocht. Indien de douane reeds
over gegevens beschikt die voor haar voldoende zijn om zonder nader onderzoek
te kunnen beoordelen of aan een van de in lid 2, onder b. bedoelde criteria
is voldaan, heeft zij geen reden om van de importeur te eisen dat deze aantoont
dat aan de criteria kan worden voldaan. Onder &#x201E;niet verbonden kopers&#x201D;
worden in lid 2, onder b. verstaan kopers die in geen enkel geval met de verkoper
verbonden zijn.</al>

                     <al>Bij het beantwoorden van de vraag of een waarde een ander waarde zeer
dicht benadert, moet een aantal factoren in aanmerking worden genomen, waaronder
de aard van de ingevoerde goederen en van de betrokken bedrijfstak, het seizoen
waarin de goederen worden ingevoerd en de vraag of het verschil tussen de
onderscheidene waarden uit commercieel oogpunt significant is. Aangezien deze
factoren van geval tot geval kunnen verschillen, is het onmogelijk in alle
gevallen een eenvormige norm, zoals bijvoorbeeld een vast percentage, te hanteren.
Zo kan bijvoorbeeld voor het beantwoorden van de vraag of de transactiewaarde
de in artikel 1, lid 1, onder b. bedoelde referentiewaarden zeer dicht benadert
een gering verschil in waarde voor een bepaald type goederen onaanvaardbaar
zijn, terwijl bij een ander type goederen een groot verschil wel aanvaardbaar
kan zijn.</al></divisie></divisie><divisie><kop><titel>Aantekening bij artikel 2 </titel></kop><lijst>

en exact zijn, bijvoorbeeld actuele prijslijsten van de voor de verschillende
niveaus of hoeveelheden geldende prijzen. Het kan bijvoorbeeld voorkomen dat
de ingevoerde goederen waarvan de waarde wordt bepaald een zending van 10
eenheden vormen en de enige ingevoerde identieke goederen waarvoor een transactiewaarde
bestaat in een partij van 500 eenheden zijn verkocht. Indien in dergelijk

soortgelijke goederen verstaan een overeenkomstig lid 1, onder b. en lid 2
gecorrigeerde douanewaarde die reeds is aanvaard uit hoofde van artikel 1.</al>

                           <al> Aan correcties voor verschillen in handelsniveau of hoeveelheid wordt,
ongeacht of zij een verhoging dan wel een verlaging van de waarde ten gevolg
hebben, de voorwaarde verbonden dat zij gebaseerd zijn op bewijsmateriaal
waaruit blijkt dat zij redelijk en exact zijn, bijvoorbeeld actuele prijslijsten
waarin de prijzen voor verschillende niveaus of hoeveelheden vermeld zijn.
Het kan bijvoorbeeld voorkomen dat de ingevoerde goederen waarvan de waarde
wordt bepaald een zending van 10 eenheden vormen en de enige ingevoerde identieke
goederen waarvoor een transactiewaarde bestaat, in een zending van 500 eenheden
zijn verkocht. Indien dan bekend is dat de verkoper hoeveel- heidskortingen
geeft kunnen op basis van de prijslijst van de verkoper de noodzakelijke aanpassingen
worden verricht door de daarin vermelde prijs op een verkoop van 10 eenheden
toe te passen. Dit betekent niet dat de betrokken goederen reeds in een hoeveelheid
van 10 eenheden moeten zijn verkocht, mits bij verkopen in andere hoeveelheden
is vastgesteld dat de prijslijst bona fide is. Bij gebreke van een dergelijke
objectieve maatstaf kan de douanewaarde niet overeenkomstig het bepaalde in
artikel 3 worden vastgesteld.</al>

                           <al> Aangenomen wordt dat de in artikel 5, lid 2 bedoelde methode van waardebepaling
normaliter geen toepassing kan vinden wanneer de ingevoerde goederen ten gevolge

zijn, de door de bewerking of verwerking toegevoegde waarde op vrij eenvoudige
wijze kan worden vastgesteld. Het is evenwel ook mogelijk dat de ingevoerde
goederen weliswaar identificeerbaar blijven, doch een dermate onbelangrijk
deel uitmaken van de in het land van invoer verkochte goederen dat het gebruik
van deze methode van waardebepaling niet gerechtvaardigd zou zijn. In de bovenomschreven
omstandigheden dient elk geval derhalve op zijn eigen merites te worden beoordeeld.</al>

vastgesteld op basis van gegevens die in het land van invoer direct beschikbaar
zijn. Voor het vaststellen van een berekende waarde kan het evenwel noodzakelijk
zijn zowel de produktiekosten van de goederen waarvan de waarde wordt bepaald
als andere buiten het land van invoer in te winnen inlichtingen aan een onderzoek
te onderwerpen. Daar komt nog bij dat de producent van de goederen meestal
niet onder de jurisdictie van de autoriteiten van het land van invoer valt.
De methode van de berekende waarde zal doorgaans enkel worden gebruikt in
gevallen waarin de koper en de verkoper verbonden zijn en de producent van
de goederen bereid is de autoriteiten van het land van invoer de nodige gegevens
voor de kostprijsberekening mede te delen en een eventueel noodzakelijk nader
onderzoek mogelijk te maken.</al>

aantekening bij artikel 8, van elk in artikel 8, lid 1, onder b. omschreven
element dat door de koper rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks is geleverd voor

in artikel 8, lid 1, onder b., punt iv. bedoelde werkzaamheden die in het
land van invoer worden verricht, wordt slechts in de kosten of de waarde begrepen
voor zover zij de producent van de goederen in rekening wordt gebracht. De

cijfers te worden vastgesteld, tenzij deze niet in overeenstemming zijn met
die welke door de producenten in het land van uitvoer normaliter worden ingecalculeerd
bij de verkoop van voor uitvoer naar het land van invoer bestemde goederen
van dezelfde aard of soort als de goederen waarvan de waarde wordt bepaald.</al>

                           <al> Wat dit betreft zij opgemerkt dat het &#x201E;bedrag voor winst en
algemene kosten&#x201D; als &#xE9;&#xE9;n geheel moet worden beschouwd. Hieruit
volgt dat, indien in een bepaald geval de winst van een producent laag is
en zijn algemene kosten hoog, de winst en de algemene kosten van deze producent,
tezamen genomen, niettemin in overeenstemming kunnen zijn met die welke gewoonlijk
worden ingecalculeerd bij de verkoop van goederen van dezelfde aard of soort.
Een dergelijke situatie kan zich bijvoorbeeld voordoen wanneer een produkt
voor het eerst in het land van invoer op de markt wordt gebracht en de producent
bereid is zonder winst te verkopen of genoegen neemt met een lage winstmarge
als tegenwicht voor de aan de introductie van het produkt verbonden algemene
kosten. Indien de producent kan aantonen dat hij als gevolg van bijzonder
handelsomstandigheden een lage winst maakt bij de verkoop van de ingevoerde
goederen, dient het bedrag van zijn werkelijke winst in aanmerking te worden
genomen mits hij dit met redelijke commerci&#xEB;le argumenten kan onderbouwen
en zijn prijsstellingsmethode de gebruikelijke wijze van prijsstelling in
de desbetreffende tak van industrie weerspiegelt. Dit is bijvoorbeeld het
geval wanneer producenten gedwongen worden hun prijzen tijdelijk te verlagen
wegens een niet te voorspellen inkrimping van de vraag of wanneer zij goederen
verkopen ter aanvulling van een in het land van invoer vervaardigd assortiment
en zij ter handhaving van hun concurrentiepositie genoegen nemen met een lagere
winst. Indien de door de producent zelf verstrekte cijfers voor winst en algemene
kosten niet in overeenstemming zijn met die welke normaliter door de producenten
in het land van uitvoer worden ingecalculeerd bij de verkoop van voor uitvoer
naar het land van invoer bestemde goederen van dezelfde aard of soort als
de goederen waarvan de waarde wordt bepaald, dan kan het bedrag voor winst
en algemene kosten worden vastgesteld aan de hand van andere relevante informatie
dan die welke door of namens de producent van de goederen is verstrekt.</al>

                           <al> Indien voor de vaststelling van een berekende waarde andere dan de
door of namens de producent van de goederen verstrekte inlichtingen worden

elementen over de ingevoerde goederen dient rekening te worden gehouden met
twee factoren, namelijk de waarde van het element zelf en de wijze waarop
deze waarde over de ingevoerde goederen moet worden omgeslagen. De omslag
van deze elementen geschiedt op een redelijke, aan de omstandigheden aangepaste
wijze en met inachtneming van de algemeen aanvaarde boekhoudkundige beginselen.</al>

                           <al> Wat de waarde van het element betreft, zij opgemerkt dat indien de
importeur het element tegen een bepaalde kostprijs verkrijgt van een verkoper
die niet met hem is verbonden, deze kostprijs de waarde van het element vormt.
Indien dit element door de importeur of een met hem verbonden persoon werd
geproduceerd, is de waarde ervan gelijk aan de produktiekosten. Indien het
element eerder door de importeur werd gebruikt, ongeacht of het door hem werd
verkregen of vervaardigd, dienen de oorspronkelijke kosten van de verwerving
of de produktie ervan naar beneden te worden aangepast om dit gebruik tot
uitdrukking te brengen en aldus de waarde van dit element te bepalen.</al>

                           <al> Eenmaal de waarde van de elementen vastgesteld dient deze over de ingevoerde
goederen te worden omgeslagen. Hiervoor bestaan verschillende methoden. De
waarde kan bijvoorbeeld aan de eerste zending worden toegerekend indien de
importeur het invoerrecht over de totale waarde in &#xE9;&#xE9;n keer
wenst te betalen. Ook is het mogelijk dat de importeur de wens te kennen geeft
dat de waarde wordt omgeslagen over het aantal eenheden dat tot het tijdstip
van de eerste zending is vervaardigd. Hij kan ook vragen dat de waarde over
de gehele geraamde produktie wordt omgeslagen, indien voor die produktie kontrakten
of definitieve verbintenissen bestaan. De wijze van toerekening wordt met
inachtneming van de door de importeur verstrekte gegevens vastgesteld.</al>

een importeur levert aan de producent van de goederen een matrijs die bij
de vervaardiging van de in te voeren goederen zal worden gebruikt. Hij verbindt
zich ertoe 10.000 eenheden van het produkt te kopen. Bij aankomst van de eerste
zending van 1.000 eenheden heeft de producent reeds 4.000 eenheden vervaardigd.
De importeur kan de douane dan verzoeken de waarde van de matrijs over 1.000,
4.000 of 10.000 eenheden om te slaan.</al>

soorten produkten uit diverse landen invoert, voor haar buiten het land van
invoer gelegen ontwerpcentrum een boekhouding voert die de aan een bepaald
produkt toe te rekenen kosten nauwkeurig aangeeft. In dergelijke gevallen
is een directe aanpassing in de zin van artikel 8 verantwoord.</al>

ontwerpcentrum echter ook boeken als algemene kosten die niet over bepaalde
produkten worden omgeslagen. In dergelijk geval zou ten aanzien van de ingevoerde
goederen een passende correctie in de zin van artikel 8 kunnen plaatsvinden
door de totale kosten van het designcentrum om te slaan over de totale produktie
waarop de diensten van het centrum betrekking hebben en de aldus omgeslagen
kosten toe te voegen aan de waarde per eenheid van de ingevoerde goederen.</al>

er wordt een royalty betaald op basis van de prijs bij verkoop in het land
van invoer van &#xE9;&#xE9;n liter van een bepaald produkt dat per kg
werd ingevoerd en dat na de invoer aan een oplossing wordt toegevoegd. Indien
de royalty ten dele gebaseerd is op de ingevoerde goederen en ten dele op

wanneer ingevoerde goederen met binnenlandse bestanddelen worden vermengd
en zij niet langer als zodanig kunnen worden ge&#xEF;dentificeerd of wanneer
de royalty niet van bepaalde bijzondere financi&#xEB;le regelingen tussen
de koper en de verkoper kan worden onderscheiden), zou een toevoeging voor
royalties niet correct zijn. Indien het bedrag van de royalty evenwel uitsluitend
op de ingevoerde goederen gebaseerd is en zich op eenvoudige wijze laat kwantificeren

dat &#x201E;de multilaterale handelsbesprekingen in het kader van de Uruguay-Ronde
gericht zijn op een verdere liberalisering en uitbreiding van de wereldhandel,
een versterking van de rol van de GATT en een verbetering van het vermogen
van het GATT-stelsel zich aan de ontwikkelingen van het internationale economische
klimaat aan te passen;</al>
                     <al>Geleid door de wens de doelstellingen van de GATT 1994 na te streven;</al>
                     <al>Erkennend dat duidelijke en voorspelbare oorsprongsregels en de toepassing
van deze regels het internationale handelsverkeer vergemakkelijken;</al>
                     <al>Geleid door de wens ervoor te zorgen dat de oorsprongsregels zelf het
handelsverkeer niet onnodig belemmeren;</al>

deze overeenkomst &#x201E;Commissie&#x201D; genoemd) die bestaat uit vertegenwoordigers
van alle Leden. De Commissie kiest haar voorzitter en komt bijeen wanneer
dit nodig is, doch ten minste &#xE9;&#xE9;nmaal per jaar, ten einde de
Leden de gelegenheid te geven met elkaar overleg te plegen over zaken in verband
met de toepassing van de Delen I, II, III en IV of de realisatie van de daarin
genoemde doelstellingen en om andere taken te vervullen waarmee ze op grond
van deze overeenkomst of door de Raad Goederenverkeer is belast. De Commissie
vraagt de in punt b. genoemde Technische Commissie zo nodig inlichtingen en
advies over aangelegenheden die met deze overeenkomst verband houden. De Commissie
kan de Technische Commissie ook vragen andere werkzaamheden uit te voeren
die zij voor de realisatie van de bovengenoemde doelstellingen van deze Overeenkomst
nuttig acht. Het Secretariaat van de WTO neemt het secretariaat van de Commissie
waar.</al>

exportsubsidie inhoudt, bijvoorbeeld wanneer een normale rente in rekening

zij zeggenschap hebben of waarover dezelfde persoon of onderneming zeggenschap
heeft voor belastingdoeleinden de prijzen moeten zijn die tussen onafhankelijke
ondernemingen worden toegepast onder voorwaarden van vrije concurrentie. Elk
Lid kan de aandacht van een ander Lid op administratieve of andere praktijken
vestigen die met dit beginsel in strijd kunnen zijn en waardoor bij exporttransacties
aanzienlijk minder directe belastingen worden betaald. Onder dergelijke omstandigheden

van de mogelijkheden die bestaande bilaterale belastingovereenkomsten of andere
speciale internationale regelingen bieden, onverminderd de rechten en plichten

                           <al>Volgens punt i. van de lijst van voorbeelden kunnen binnenlandse produktiemiddelen
in plaats van invoergoederen bij de vervaardiging van een exportprodukt worden
gebruikt, mits het binnenlandse produkt in dezelfde hoeveelheid wordt gebruikt
en dezelfde kwaliteit en kenmerken heeft als het invoergoed dat het vervangt.
Het bestaan van een verificatieregeling of -procedure is van belang omdat
de overheid van het exporterende Lid met behulp daarvan erop kan toezien en
aantonen dat de hoeveelheid produktiemiddelen waarvoor terugbetaling wordt
gevraagd niet groter is dan de hoeveelheid soortgelijke uitgevoerde produkten,
in welke vorm dan ook, en dat er geen hoger bedrag aan invoerheffingen wordt
terugbetaald dan oorspronkelijk op de betrokken invoergoederen is geheven.</al>

                           <al>Wanneer wordt aangevoerd dat terugbetalingen voor vervangingsgoederen
als subsidies zijn te beschouwen, dienen de met het onderzoek belaste autoriteiten
eerst vast te stellen of de overheid van het exporterende Lid een verificatieregeling
of -procedure kent of toepast. Wordt vastgesteld dat een dergelijke regeling
of procedure wordt toegepast, dan dienen de met onderzoek belaste autoriteiten
vervolgens te onderzoeken of de verificatieprocedures redelijk zijn, aan het
gestelde doel beantwoorden en gebaseerd zijn op in het exportland algemeen
aanvaarde handelspraktijken. Wordt vastgesteld dat dit inderdaad het geval
is en dat de procedures effectief worden toegepast, dan wordt niet vermoed
dat van subsidie sprake is. De met het onderzoek belaste autoriteiten kunnen
het nodig achten om, overeenkomstig artikel 12, lid 6, bepaalde praktische
controles uit te voeren om de inlichtingen te verifi&#xEB;ren of om zich ervan
te overtuigen dat de verificatieprocedures effectief worden toegepast.</al>

zijn, of wanneer deze procedures wel zijn ingesteld en redelijk bevonden doch
ze blijken niet of niet doelmatig te worden toegepast, dan kan er sprake zijn
van subsidie. In dergelijke gevallen dient een verder onderzoek door het exporterende
Lid op grond van de betrokken transacties te worden uitgevoerd om vast te
stellen of er teveel is betaald. Indien de met onderzoek belaste autoriteiten
zulks nodig achten, wordt een verder onderzoek uitgevoerd overeenkomstig lid

rechten en plichten, met inachtneming van de nationale beleidsdoelstellingen;</al>

hun grondgebied, nu en in de toekomst, aan regelingen te onderwerpen met het
oog op nationale beleidsdoelstellingen en dat het, gezien de ongelijke mate
van ontwikkeling van de voorschriften inzake dienstverlening in de onderscheiden
landen, vooral de ontwikkelingslanden zijn die aan de uitoefening van dit
recht behoefte hebben;</al>
                     <al>Geleid door de wens de ontwikkelingslanden steeds meer bij de handel in
diensten te betrekken en de uitbreiding van hun dienstenexport te bevorderen,

en een verbetering van de doelmatigheid en het concurrentievermogen van deze
sector;</al>

aan achtereenvolgende onderhandelingsronden deel die uiterlijk vijf jaar na
de datum van inwerkingtreding van de WTO-Overeenkomst zullen aanvangen en
daarna regelmatig zullen plaatsvinden ten einde de handel in diensten steeds
meer te liberaliseren. Deze onderhandelingen zijn gericht op de beperking
of afschaffing van maatregelen die van negatieve invloed zijn op de handel
in diensten ten einde de markten daadwerkelijk toegankelijk te maken. Hierbij
wordt gestreefd naar de bevordering van de belangen van alle deelnemers op
basis van wederzijds voordeel en het bereiken van een globaal evenwicht tussen
rechten en plichten.</al>

zijn wordt in de nodige flexibiliteit voorzien: zij behoeven minder sectoren
open te stellen, minder soorten transacties te liberaliseren, zij mogen hun
markten geleidelijk openstellen afhankelijk van hun ontwikkelingssituatie
en de opening van hun markten voor buitenlandse dienstverleners afhankelijk
stellen van voorwaarden die erop gericht zijn de in artikel IV genoemde doeleinden
te bereiken.</al>

termen en op sectorale basis, door vergelijking met de doelstellingen van
deze Overeenkomst, waaronder die van artikel IV, lid 1. In de onderhandelingsrichtsnoeren

de vorige onderhandelingen op autonome wijze hebben ondernomen, alsook, op
grond van artikel IV, lid 3, wat de speciale behandeling inhoudt van de Leden

als handelsmerken. Wanneer de desbetreffende waren of diensten niet kunnen
worden onderscheiden met de tekens op zichzelf, kunnen de Leden het in aanmerking
komen voor inschrijving afhankelijk stellen van het onderscheidend vermogen
op grond van het gebruik. De Leden kunnen als voorwaarde voor inschrijving

de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze Titel; de eerste toetsing vindt plaats

die van invloed zijn op het nakomen van de verplichtingen krachtens deze bepalingen,
kunnen onder de aandacht van de Raad worden gebracht; op verzoek van een Lid
pleegt de Raad overleg met een Lid of Leden betreffende een aangelegenheid
waarvoor geen bevredigende oplossing kon worden gevonden door middel van bilateraal
of plurilateraal overleg tussen de betrokken Leden. De Raad neemt de overeengekomen
stappen ter vergemakkelijking van de werking en bevordering van de doelstellingen

                        <al>Ten einde inbreuken doeltreffend tegen te gaan, hebben de rechterlijke
autoriteiten de bevoegdheid te gelasten dat goederen waarvan zij hebben vastgesteld
dat deze inbreuk maken, zonder schadevergoeding van welke aard ook, worden
onttrokken aan het verkeer op zodanige wijze dat nadeel voor de houder van
het recht wordt vermeden of, tenzij dit in strijd zou zijn met bestaande constitutionele
vereisten, deze goederen worden vernietigd. De rechterlijke autoriteiten hebben
ook de bevoegdheid te gelasten dat materialen en werktuigen, die voornamelijk
zijn gebruikt bij de voortbrenging van de inbreukmakende goederen, zonder
schadevergoeding van welke aard ook, worden onttrokken aan het verkeer op
zodanige wijze dat het gevaar van verdere inbreuken tot een minimum wordt
teruggebracht. Bij het behandelen van zulke verzoeken dient de eis van proportionaliteit
tussen de ernst van de inbreuk en de gelaste corrigerende maatregelen alsmede
de belangen van derden in aanmerking te worden genomen. Wat betreft nagemaakte
merkartikelen, is het eenvoudigweg verwijderen van het onrechtmatig aangebrachte
handelsmerk niet voldoende, behalve in uitzonderlijke gevallen, om het in
het verkeer brengen van de goederen toe te laten.</al>

worden verlengd met 10 werkdagen. Indien een procedure met het oog op een

van toepassing op geschillen die worden voorgelegd ingevolge de bepalingen
inzake overleg en geschillenbeslechting van de in Aanhangsel 1 bij dit Memorandum
van Overeenstemming vermelde overeenkomsten (hierna te noemen &#x201E;de vermelde
overeenkomsten&#x201D;). De regels en procedures van dit Memorandum van Overeenstemming
zijn ook van toepassing op consultaties en de beslechting van geschillen tussen
Leden betreffende hun rechten en verplichtingen ingevolge de bepalingen van
de Overeenkomst tot oprichting van de Wereldhandelsorganisatie (WTO) en van
dit Memorandum van Overeenstemming, hetzij afzonderlijk, hetzij in combinatie

van toepassing met inachtneming van de bijzondere of aanvullende regels en
procedures inzake geschillenbeslechting, vervat in de vermelde overeenkomsten,
die zijn aangeduid in Aanhangsel 2 bij dit Memorandum van Overeenstemming.
Voor zover er een verschil bestaat tussen de regels en procedures van dit
Memorandum van Overeenstemming en de in Aanhangsel 2 genoemde bijzondere of
aanvullende regels en procedures, hebben de bijzondere of aanvullende regels
en procedures van Aanhangsel 2 voorrang. Indien er in geschillen waarop de
regels en procedures van meer dan &#xE9;&#xE9;n vermelde overeenkomst
betrekking hebben, een conflict bestaat tussen de bijzondere of aanvullende
regels en procedures van de desbetreffende overeenkomsten, en de partijen
bij het geschil niet binnen twintig dagen na de vorming van het panel tot
overeenstemming kunnen komen over de regels en procedures, bepaalt de Voorzitter
van het Orgaan voor Geschillenbeslechting bedoeld in artikel 2, eerste lid
(hierna in dit Memorandum van Overeenstemming te noemen het &#x201E;DSB&#x201D;),
in overleg met de partijen bij het geschil, binnen tien dagen na een verzoek
van &#xE9;&#xE9;n van beide Leden welke regels en procedures moeten worden
gevolgd. De Voorzitter laat zich leiden door het beginsel dat, waar mogelijk,
bijzondere of aanvullende regels en procedures dienen te worden toegepast
en dat de in dit Memorandum van Overeenstemming uiteengezette regels en procedures
dienen te worden toegepast voor zover zulks noodzakelijk is om een conflict
te vermijden.</al>

tenuitvoerlegging van uitspraken en aanbevelingen en machtiging te verlenen
voor het schorsen van concessies en andere verplichtingen ingevolge de vermelde
overeenkomsten. Ten aanzien van geschillen die voortvloeien uit een vermelde

gebruikte term &#x201E;Lid&#x201D; slechts betrekking op Leden die partij zijn bij
de desbetreffende Plurilaterale Handelsovereenkomst. Wanneer het DSB de bepalingen
inzake geschillenbeslechting van een Plurilaterale Handelsovereenkomst toepast,
kunnen slechts Leden die partij zijn bij die overeenkomst deelnemen aan door

verheldering van de bestaande bepalingen van die overeenkomsten in overeenstemming
met de gebruikelijke interpretatieregels van het internationaal publiek recht.

te zijn met die overeenkomsten en mogen voordelen die een Lid ingevolge die

voorgelegd ingevolge de bepalingen inzake overleg en geschillenbeslechting

        <lidnr status="officieel">7</lidnr>
        <al> Alvorens een zaak aanhangig te maken beoordeelt een Lid zelf of handelen
overeenkomstig deze procedures zinvol zou zijn. De regeling inzake geschillenbeslechting
heeft tot doel een positieve oplossing voor een geschil te bewerkstelligen.
Een oplossing die wederzijds aanvaardbaar is voor de partijen bij het geschil
en die verenigbaar is met de vermelde overeenkomsten, verdient duidelijk de
voorkeur. Bij gebreke van een onderling overeengekomen oplossing, is normaliter
de eerste doelstelling van de regeling inzake geschillenbeslechting te bewerkstelligen
dat de desbetreffende maatregelen worden ingetrokken indien deze onverenigbaar
worden geacht met de bepalingen van &#xE9;&#xE9;n van de vermelde overeenkomsten.
Tot het bieden van compensatie dient slechts de toevlucht te worden genomen
indien de onmiddellijke intrekking van de maatregel niet uitvoerbaar is en
dan slechts als tijdelijke maatregel in afwachting van de intrekking van de
maatregel die onverenigbaar is met een vermelde overeenkomst. Het laatste
hulpmiddel dat dit Memorandum van Overeenstemming biedt voor het Lid dat de
procedures voor geschillenbeslechting inroept, is de mogelijkheid de toepassing
van concessies of andere verplichtingen ingevolge de vermelde overeenkomsten
op discriminatoire wijze jegens het andere Lid te schorsen, op voorwaarde
dat het DSB machtiging verleent voor dergelijke maatregelen.</al>

        <lidnr status="officieel">8</lidnr>

        <al> In gevallen waarin sprake is van niet-nakoming van de ingevolge een
vermelde overeenkomst aangegane verplichtingen, wordt de actie vooralsnog
beschouwd als een geval van tenietdoen of uitholling. Dit betekent dat normaliter
wordt verondersteld dat een schending van de regels een nadelig effect heeft
voor andere Leden die partij zijn bij die vermelde overeenkomst, en in die
gevallen is het aan het Lid waartegen de klacht is ingediend om de beschuldiging
te weerleggen.</al>

in een streven het geschil op te lossen. Er bestaat tevens overeenstemming
over het feit dat klachten en klachten in reconventie met betrekking tot verschillende
kwesties niet dienen te worden gevoegd.</al>

van Overeenstemming, te beroepen op de desbetreffende bepalingen van het Besluit
van de Overeenkomstsluitende Partijen van 5 april 1966 (BISD 14S/18), met
dien verstande dat indien het panel van oordeel is dat de in paragraaf 7 van

termijn met instemming van de klager kan worden verlengd. Voor zover er een

voorgelegd. Tenzij het DSB anders beslist, wordt de kwestie van de tenuitvoerlegging

geplaatst, zulks na zes maanden na de vaststelling van de redelijke termijn
ingevolge het derde lid, en blijft deze op de agenda van het DSB staan totdat
de kwestie is opgelost. Uiterlijk tien dagen voor elke zodanige bijeenkomst

Aan compensatie of aan schorsing van concessies of andere verplichtingen wordt
evenwel niet de voorkeur gegeven boven volledige tenuitvoerlegging van een

overeenkomsten. Compensatie geschiedt vrijwillig en dient, indien toegestaan,

geachte maatregel daarmee niet in overeenstemming brengt, of anderszins de
aanbevelingen en uitspraken niet naleeft binnen de ingevolge artikel 21, derde
lid, vastgestelde termijn, gaat dat Lid, indien hierom wordt verzocht, uiterlijk
bij het verstrijken van de redelijke termijn onderhandelingen aan met een
partij die een beroep heeft gedaan op de procedures voor geschillenbeslechting,
teneinde tot een wederzijds aanvaardbare compensatie te komen. Indien binnen
twintig dagen na het verstrijken van de redelijke termijn geen bevredigende
compensatie is overeengekomen, kan een partij die een beroep op de procedures
voor geschillenbeslechting heeft gedaan, verzoeken om een machtiging van het
DSB tot schorsing van de toepassing van concessies of andere verplichtingen

                           <al>Doel van de regeling inzake toetsing van het handelsbeleid (Trade Policy
Review Mechanism &#x2013; TPRM) is een betere naleving door alle Leden van
de in de multilaterale handelsovereenkomsten en eventuele plurilaterale handelsovereenkomsten
opgenomen regels, disciplines en verbintenissen, en derhalve een vlottere
werking van het multilaterale handelsstelsel als gevolg van een grotere doorzichtigheid
van en meer inzicht in het handelsbeleid en de handelspraktijken van de Leden.
De toetsingsregeling maakt bijgevolg de geregelde gezamenlijke beoordeling
en evaluatie mogelijk van alle handelspolitieken en -praktijken van de afzonderlijke
Leden en de invloed ervan op de werking van het multilateraal handelsstelsel.
Het is evenwel niet de bedoeling dat zij wordt aangewend als grondslag voor
het doen naleven van bepaalde verplichtingen in het kader van de overeenkomsten
of voor geschillenbeslechtingsprocedures dan wel voor het aan Leden opleggen
van nieuwe beleidsmatige verplichtingen.</al>

dat aangewezen is, plaats tegen de achtergrond van de meer algemene behoeften,
beleidslijnen en doelstellingen van het betrokken Lid op economisch en ontwikkelingsgebied,
evenals van de toestand in zijn buitenlandse omgeving. Oogmerk van de toetsingsregeling
is evenwel het onderzoek van de invloed van het handelsbeleid en de handelspraktijken
van een Lid op het multilateraal handelsstelsel.</al></li></lijst>

op handelspolitiek gebied de intrinsieke waarde van interne doorzichtigheid
voor zowel de economie van de Leden als het multilateraal handelsstelsel en
komen overeen het tot stand brengen van grotere doorzichtigheid binnen hun
eigen stelsels aan te moedigen en te bevorderen, terwijl zij inzien dat de
interne doorzichtigheid op vrijwillige basis tot stand moet komen en dat daarbij
rekening dient te worden gehouden met de wettelijke en politieke stelsels

                     <li><li.nr>ii.</li.nr><al>Het handelsbeleid en handelspraktijken van alle Leden worden periodiek
getoetst. Voor het vaststellen van de frequentie van de toetsen wordt uitgegaan
van de invloed van de afzonderlijke Leden op de werking van het multilateraal
handelsstelsel, die wordt vastgesteld op grond van hun aandeel in de wereldhandel
gedurende een recente representatieve periode. De aldus ge&#xEF;dentificeerde
vier voornaamste handelsentiteiten (waarbij de Europese Gemeenschap als &#xE9;&#xE9;n
entiteit wordt beschouwd) worden om de twee jaar getoetst. De daaropvolgende
zestien worden om de vier jaar getoetst en de andere leden om de zes jaar
met dien verstande dat voor de Leden die minstontwikkelde landen zijn, langere
perioden kunnen worden vastgesteld. De toetsing van entiteiten met een gemeenschappelijk
buitenlands beleid voor verschillende Leden dient alle op de handel betrekking
hebbende componenten van het beleid met inbegrip van de relevante beleidslijnen
en praktijken van de afzonderlijke leden te bestrijken. In exceptionele gevallen,
wanneer in het handelsbeleid of de handelspraktijken van een Lid wijzigingen
worden aangebracht welke een belangrijke impact op zijn handelspartners kunnen
hebben, kan het betrokken Lid door het TPRB na raadpleging worden verzocht
de eerstvolgende toetsing vroeger te laten plaatshebben.</al></li><li><li.nr>iii.</li.nr><al>Bij de besprekingen op de vergaderingen van het TPRB wordt uitgegaan

kader van de toetsingsregeling worden beoordeeld.</al></li><li><li.nr>iv.</li.nr><al>Het TPRB stelt voor zijn toetsingswerkzaamheden een basisplan op.
Het kan eveneens de verslagen met de meest recente gegevens van de Leden bespreken
en er nota van nemen. Het TPRB stelt voor ieder jaar in overleg met de rechtstreeks
betrokken Leden een toetsingsprogramma op. De voorzitter kan, in overleg met
het Lid of de Leden van wie het beleid wordt getoetst, discussianten kiezen
die, in hun persoonlijke hoedanigheid, de besprekingen binnen het TPRB inleiden.</al></li><li><li.nr>v.</li.nr><al>Het TPRB maakt voor zijn werkzaamheden gebruik van de volgende documentatie:</al><lijst type="expliciet">

geregeld verslag uit aan het TPRB. In de omstandige verslagen worden het handelsbeleid
en de handelspraktijken van het betrokken Lid of de betrokken Leden beschreven
volgens een overeengekomen model dat door het TPRB wordt vastgesteld. Voor
dit model wordt voorlopig gebruik gemaakt van het ontwerp-model voor landenrapporten
vastgesteld bij besluit van 19  juli  1989 (BISD  36S/406&#x2013;409), dat
zo nodig wordt gewijzigd om in de verslagen alle aspecten van het handelsbeleid
te kunnen behandelen waarop de in bijlage  1 genoemde multilaterale handelsovereenkomsten
en eventueel de plurilaterale handelsovereenkomsten betrekking hebben. Dit
model kan door het TPRB in het licht van de ervaring worden herzien. In de
tussen twee toetsingen verlopende periode dienen de leden beknopte verslagen
in wanneer zij hun handelsbeleid in belangrijke mate wijzigen; de meest recente
statistische gegevens worden jaarlijks in overeenstemming met het overeengekomen
model ingediend. Er wordt speciale aandacht besteed aan de moeilijkheden welke
bij het opstellen van de verslagen worden ondervonden door Leden die minstontwikkelde
landen zijn. Het secretariaat stelt op verzoek technische bijstand ter beschikking
van Leden die ontwikkelingslanden zijn en vooral van Leden die minstontwikkelde
landen zijn. Er wordt gestreefd naar zoveel mogelijk co&#xF6;rdinatie tussen
de gegevens welke worden opgenomen in de verslagen en in de kennisgevingen
welke op grond van bepalingen van de multilaterale handelsovereenkomsten en
eventueel de plurilaterale handelsovereenkomsten worden gedaan.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><label>E.</label><titel>Verband met de bepalingen betreffende de betalingsbalans van de GATT

die op grond van de betalingsbalansbepalingen van de GATT  1994 of de GATS
eveneens uitvoerig moeten kunnen worden geraadpleegd, zo klein mogelijk te
houden. De voorzitter van het TPRB werkt met het oog daarop, in overleg met
het betrokken Lid of de betrokken Leden en met de voorzitter van de Commissie
Beperkingen ten behoeve van de betalingsbalans, administratieve regelingen
uit voor het in overeenstemming brengen van de gewone frequentie van de toetsingen
van het handelsbeleid met het tijdschema voor het overleg betreffende de betalingsbalans,

               </kop><wettekst><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>1</nr></kop><al> De ministers erkennen dat de mondialisering van de wereldeconomie heeft
geleid tot een steeds verdergaande wisselwerking tussen het economisch beleid
van de afzonderlijke landen, met inbegrip van een wisselwerking tussen de
structurele, macro-economische, handels-, financi&#xEB;le en ontwikkelingsaspecten
van het economisch beleid. De taak om dit beleid te harmoniseren berust primair
bij de regeringen op nationaal niveau, maar de samenhang op internationale
schaal is een belangrijke en waardevolle factor ter vergroting van de doeltreffendheid
van het beleid op nationaal niveau. De in het kader van de Uruguay-Ronde tot
stand gekomen overeenkomsten tonen aan dat alle deelnemende regeringen erkennen
dat een liberaal handelsbeleid kan bijdragen tot een gezonde groei en ontwikkeling
van hun eigen economie en de gehele wereldeconomie.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>2</nr></kop><al> Geslaagde samenwerking op een bepaald gebied van het economisch beleid
draagt bij tot vooruitgang op andere gebieden. Grotere stabiliteit van de
wisselkoersen, op basis van meer ordelijke economische en financi&#xEB;le
voorwaarden, zou moeten bijdragen tot uitbreiding van de handel, duurzame
groei en ontwikkeling en herstel van externe onevenwichtigheden. Er is ook
behoefte aan een passende en tijdige stroom concessionele en niet-concessionele
financi&#xEB;le middelen alsmede gelden voor investeringen naar de ontwikkelingslanden
en aan meer inspanningen om de schuldenproblematiek aan te pakken, om te zorgen
voor economische groei en ontwikkeling. Vrijmaking van het handelsverkeer
vormt een steeds belangrijkere factor voor het welslagen van de aanpassingsprogramma's
die veel landen uitvoeren, waarmee veelal aanzienlijke kosten zijn gemoeid
die in de overgangsfase vaak zwaar op de samenleving drukken. In dit verband
wijzen de ministers op de rol van de Wereldbank en het IMF bij het bieden
van steun aan aanpassing aan de vrijmaking van het handelsverkeer, met inbegrip
van steun aan netto voedsel importerende ontwikkelingslanden die op de korte
termijn worden geconfronteerd met kosten ten gevolge van hervormingen van
de handel in landbouwprodukten.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>3</nr></kop><al> Het positieve resultaat van de Uruguay-Ronde is een belangrijke bijdrage
aan een meer samenhangend en aanvullend internationaal economisch beleid.
De resultaten van de Uruguay-Ronde bieden ruimere toegang tot de markt in
het voordeel van alle landen, alsmede een kader van versterkte multilaterale
gedragsregels voor het handelsverkeer. Zij garanderen ook dat het handelsbeleid
op een meer doorzichtige wijze wordt gevoerd, met een groter besef van de
voordelen van een open handelsstelsel voor het binnenlandse concurrentievermogen.
Het versterkte multilaterale handelsstelsel dat uit de Uruguay-Ronde voorkomt,
leent zich ertoe een verbeterd forum voor liberalisering te bieden, bij te
dragen tot doeltreffender toezicht en te zorgen voor een strikte naleving
van de multilateraal overeengekomen regels en methoden. Deze verbeteringen
betekenen dat het handelsbeleid in de toekomst een gewichtiger rol kan spelen
in de totstandbrenging van samenhang in het mondiale economische beleid.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>4</nr></kop><al> De ministers erkennen echter dat moeilijkheden waarvan de oorzaak buiten
het handelsterrein is gelegen, niet enkel met maatregelen op handelsgebied
kunnen worden verholpen. Hiermee wordt het belang onderstreept van pogingen
om andere elementen van het mondiale economische beleid te verbeteren ter
aanvulling van de effectieve toepassing van de in het kader van de Uruguay-Ronde
bereikte resultaten.</al></artikel><artikel status="goed"><kop><nr>5</nr></kop><al> De onderlinge verbanden tussen de verschillende aspecten van het economisch
beleid vergen dat de internationale instellingen die verantwoordelijkheden
op deze terreinen hebben, een samenhangend en wederzijds ondersteunend beleid
voeren. De Wereldhandelsorganisatie dient derhalve te streven naar samenwerking
met internationale organisaties die zijn belast met monetaire en financi&#xEB;le
aangelegenheden, en deze tot ontwikkeling te brengen, waarbij het mandaat,
de vereisten inzake vertrouwelijkheid en de noodzakelijke autonomie in besluitvormingsprocedures
van elke instelling worden ge&#xEB;erbiedigd en het opleggen van eencross-conditionality -beding of extra voorwaarden aan regeringen wordt
vermeden. De ministers verzoeken de Directeur-Generaal van de WTO te zamen
met de Directeur van het Internationale Monetaire Fonds en de President van
de Wereldbank te bezien wat de gevolgen zijn van de taken van de WTO voor
de samenwerking met de Bretton Woods-instellingen en in welke vorm deze samenwerking
zou kunnen geschieden, teneinde te komen tot een grotere samenhang in het
mondiale economische beleid.<nadruk type="cur">cross-conditionality</nadruk> -beding of extra voorwaarden aan regeringen wordt
