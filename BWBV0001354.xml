            <al> The privileges and immunities granted under the provisions of
              this Agreement are conferred in the interests of Europol and not
              for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves. It is the
              duty of Europol and all persons enjoying such privileges and
              immunities to observe in all other respects the laws and
              regulations of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</al>

            <al> The Director shall be required to waive the immunity of any
              expert, or representative of a third State or international
              organisation as mentioned in Article XII, paragraph 6, in cases
              where the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be
              waived without prejudice to the interests of Europol. In respect
              of Members of the Joint Supervisory Body, the waiving of the
              immunities shall be within the competence of the respective Member States.</al>

            <al> Europol shall co-operate at all times with the appropriate Host
              State authorities to facilitate the proper administration of
              justice and shall prevent any abuse of the privileges and
              immunities granted under the provisions of this Agreement.</al>

            <al> Should the Government consider that an abuse of a privilege or
              immunity conferred by this Agreement has occurred, the Director
              shall, upon request, consult with the appropriate Host State
              authorities to determine whether any such abuse has occurred. If
              such consultations fail to achieve a result satisfactory to the
              Director and to the Government, the matter shall be settled in
              accordance with the procedure set out in Article XIX.</al>
