        <titel>Protocol No. 2 to the European Outline Convention on
          Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or
          Authorities concerning interterritorial co-operation</titel>
      </kop>
      <aanhef><preambule><al>Preamble</al><al>The member States of the Council of Europe signatory to this
            Protocol No. 2 to the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier
            Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities,</al>
          <al>Considering the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the
            Outline Convention, on 9 November 1995, concerning the legal effects
            of acts performed within the framework of transfrontier co-operation
            and of the legal status of any co-operation bodies set up by
            transfrontier co-operation agreements;</al>
          <al>Considering that in order to perform their functions effectively,
            territorial communities or authorities are increasingly co-operating
            not only with neighbouring authorities of other States
            (transfrontier co-operation), but also with foreign non-neighbouring
            authorities having common interests (interterritorial co-operation),
            and are doing so not only within the framework of transfrontier
            co-operation bodies and associations of territorial communities or
            authorities but also at bilateral level;</al>
          <al>Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration of 1993 of the Heads of
            State and government of the member States, which recognised the role
            of the Council of Europe in the creation of a tolerant and
            prosperous Europe through transfrontier co-operation of territorial
            communities or authorities;</al>
          <al>Noting that in the field of interterritorial co-operation there is
            no instrument comparable to the Outline Convention;</al>
          <al>Wishing to give interterritorial co-operation an international
            legal framework,</al>
          <al>Have agreed the following provisions:</al>
