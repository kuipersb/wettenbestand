			 <al>Seeking to improve the present situation and to strengthen their

				standard or interoperable equipment, and</al>
			 <al>Recalling that they had agreed, as members of the Alliance, to
				maximum cooperation in procurement as set forth in Annex A to NATO Document
				C-M(73)51 (revised), dated 20 August 1973,</al>
			 <al>Have entered into this Memorandum of Understanding in order to
				achieve the above aims.</al>
			 <al>This Memorandum of Understanding sets out the guiding principles
				governing mutual cooperation in research and development, production and
				procurement of conventional defense equipment.</al>
			 <al>The two Governments conclude this MOU to strengthen the North
				Atlantic Alliance. In so doing, the Governments are fully aware that the
				Independent European Program Group (IEPG) wants to enhance equipment
				collaboration by more comprehensive and systematic arrangements. They therefore
				agree that in the event of a possible conflict between agreements entered into
				between the IEPG and the Government of the United States, and this MOU, the
				parties hereto will consult with a view to amending this MOU.</al>
			 <al>The two Governments further agree that this MOU should be viewed
				in the larger context of the cooperation between Europe and North America
				within the Alliance and that this cooperation will be carried out pursuant to
				the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between the Government of the United
				States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, signed
				27 January 1950.</al>

				<al>Both Governments intend to facilitate the mutual flow of
				  defense procurement, taking into consideration relative technological levels of
				  such procurement, and consistent with their national policies. This
				  facilitation shall be sought through the provision of opportunities to compete
				  for procurements of defense equipment and services as well as through the
				  coproduction of defense equipment and defense R&amp;D cooperation.</al>
			 </lid>
			 <lid><lidnr status="officieel">2</lidnr>
				<al>This MOU is intended to cover areas in which possible bilateral
				  cooperation could be achieved in research and development, production and
				  procurement of conventional defense equipment, complementing the work of the
				  Conference of National Armament Directors (CNAD) and the Independent European
				  Program Group (IEPG).</al>
			 </lid>
			 <lid><lidnr status="officieel">3</lidnr>
				<al>The two Governments will, consistent with their relevant laws
				  and regulations, give the fullest consideration to all requests for cooperative
				  R&amp;D, and to all requests for production and procurement which are intended
				  to enhance standardization and/or interoperability within the Alliance.</al>
			 </lid>
			 <lid><lidnr status="officieel">4</lidnr>
				<al>In the interests of standardization and the effective
				  utilization of scarce resources, the two Governments shall, to the extent
				  possible, adopt qualified defense items that have been developed or produced in
				  the other country to meet their requirements. Defense items or services are
				  those items or services which may be procured utilizing appropriated funds of
				  the U.S. Department of Defense or budgeted funds of the Netherlands Ministry of
				  Defense.</al>
			 </lid>
			 <lid><lidnr status="officieel">5</lidnr>
				<al>The two Governments shall mutually determine the counting

				  defense items and defense services purchased by them directly or through their
				  relevant industries under this MOU.</al>
			 </lid>
			 <lid><lidnr status="officieel">6</lidnr>
				<al>Each Government shall from time to time notify the other

			 </lid>
			 <lid><lidnr status="officieel">11</lidnr>
				<al>Each Government will ensure that the technical data packages
				  (TDP's) made available under this MOU are not used for any purpose other than
				  for the purpose of bidding on, and performing, a prospective defense contract
				  without the prior agreement of those owning or controlling proprietary rights
				  and that full protection shall be given to such proprietary rights, or to any
				  privileged, protected, or classified data and information they contain. In no

				  transferee without the prior written consent of the originating
				  Government.</al>

			 which the governments will provide each other with selected contract
			 administration services and related information in support of defense contracts

		  <al>The objective of this annex is to insure each government is able to
			 employ the most effective and efficient contract administration support
			 possible when acting under the MOU. Nothing is to be construed as impairing a
			 purchasing government's access to its contractors and their records as may be
			 contractually authorized.</al>
		  <al>For the purpose of this annex, contract administration shall
			 include all those necessary actions, other than contract pricing and audit, to
			 be accomplished at, or in proximity to, a firm's place of business to assist
			 the purchasing office in evaluating a prospective contractor's capabilities and
			 in monitoring and enforcing awarded contracts. This annex supplements NATO
			 Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4107

		  <al>The purchasing government may request specific services and
			 information selected from those listed in appendix 1 to this annex which it
			 considers appropriate to the circumstances. The purchasing government may elect
			 to obtain additional support through its own on-site representatives provided
			 there is no duplication of work performed by the host government. In addition,
			 the host government will use its best efforts to supply information requested
			 by the purchasing government but not listed in this annex when necessary to
			 support contract award, enforcement, or termination. The purchasing government
			 may modify a request for support during contract performance after consultation
			 with the host government.</al>
		  <al>The host government shall accept requests for services to the
			 extent resources are available and carry them out according to the procedures
			 that government uses for its own contracts.</al>
		  <al>Contracts shall contain suitable provisions for the host government
			 to act for and on behalf of the purchasing government and shall authorize
			 access to contractor facilities and records and use of contractor assets as
			 necessary for the performance of contract administration services.</al>
		  <al>Where representatives of either government deal with a contractor
			 at the same location in support of the same contract or separate contracts,
			 they shall act in full concert according to terms of reference mutually agreed
			 or to be agreed upon.</al>
		  <al>Each government shall designate a single office to receive requests
			 for contract administration services. In addition, each government may elect to
			 designate an office in or near the other's country to act as a focal point
			 through which requests for support will be forwarded. The host government will
			 endeavor to keep the purchasing government's focal point apprised of current
			 contract administration practices and resources to help insure requests for
			 services are reasonable and prudent. The focal point shall advise the host
			 government concerning contract requirements and clarify requests for services
			 as necessary.</al>

the safeguarding of all classified information exchanged between the Governments.
These procedures will apply to those cases in which contracts, subcontracts,
precontract negotiations or other government approved arrangements involving
classified information of either or both countries, hereinafter referred to
as classified contracts, are placed or entered into by or on behalf of the
Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands in the United States (U.S.) or by or

a case-by-case basis by the releasing government. Such requests should identify
the source, the amount and other pertinent particulars of the foreign ownership,
control or influence.</al></li><li><li.nr>C.</li.nr><al> For the purpose of these procedures classified information is that
official information which has been determined to require, in the interests
of National Security of the owning or releasing government, protection against
unauthorized disclosure and which has so been designated by appropriate security
authority. This embraces classified information in any form, be it oral, visual
or in the form of material. Material may be any document, product or substance
on, or in which, information may be recorded or embodied. Material shall encompass
everything regardless of its physical character or makeup including documents,
writing, hardware, equipment, machinery, apparatus, devices, models, photographs,
recordings, reproductions, notes, sketches, plans, prototypes, designs, configurations,

the information with substantially the same degree of security protection
as afforded it by the releasing government. The receiving government shall
be responsible for information so received while it is within its territorial

will assume responsibility for administering security measures for a classified

under the same standards and requirements as govern the protection of their
own classified contracts.</al>

will not be reimbursed. There shall be provisions in classified contracts
for security costs to be incurred under the contract, such as special costs
for packing, transport and the like, which shall be borne by the party for

when implementing this requirement.</al>
                        <al>The method of shipment and the channels to be employed in transmitting
classified material between each government should, whenever possible, be
specified in the Security Requirements Clause of the basic contract, subcontract,
or precontract solicitation. The attached routing sheet for the transmittal
of classified documents is provided as guidance to assist in the identification
of acceptable channels for incorporation into the Security Reguirements Clause.
This routing may also be used as a procedural guideline when the need arises
to transmit documents in those instances where the pertinent aspects of the
Security Requirements Clause are unclear or not specifically adressed. The
channels described therein should not be considered as the preferred mode
in all instances. The availability and physical location of appropriate government
representatives and the classification level and size of the material involved
are all factors which must be considered.</al>

consistent with the applicable procedures and receipting requirements of each
signatory government to this Security Protocol.</al>

                     <lijst><li><li.nr>I.</li.nr><al>Introduction</al><al>This annex supersedes Annex VI entered into between the governments of
the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United States, dated April 18, 1985,
concerning Principles Governing Defense Contract Audit Services and sets forth
the terms, conditions and procedures under which the participating governments
will provide one another with defense contract audit services upon request
in support of defense contracts, subcontracts, and Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) Letters of Offer and Acceptance contemplated or executed under the Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU).</al></li><li><li.nr>II.</li.nr><al>General Principles</al><al>The objective of this annex is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of audit services available to the participating governments. Either government
may request audit services from the other government. Both governments agree
to perform the audits requested by the other government or otherwise required
by this audit annex. In the event conflicts arise between any aspect of this
annex and the laws of either participating government, the laws shall prevail.
With notice to the other participating government, the purchasing government
may elect to perform a specific audit in unusual circumstances, such as when
the performing government can not satisfy an unusually short due date for
an audit report.</al>
                     <al>Contract audit reports shall be advisory. The purchasing government shall
retain authority and responsibility for negotiating acceptable prices and
contract settlements with contractors. Purchases by the Netherlands under
the FMS Program will be handled under the U.S. FMS procedures in existence
at the time of acceptance of the FMS agreement.</al>
                     <al>When performing an audit for the U.S., the Netherlands agrees to use current
U.S. cost principles and applicable cost accounting standards. The Netherlands
also agrees that the U.S. will use its own cost principles when performing
an audit for the Netherlands. All audit reports will be written in English.
Consistent with U.S. cost principles and applicable cost accounting standards,
the performing government may use the same audit methods it customarily uses
for its own contracts, and shall determine the organizations and personnel
to be involved.</al>
                     <al>Neither participating government shall duplicate or review the work of
the other. The governments shall hold periodic discussions to evaluate the
operational effectiveness of the reciprocal agreement. In addition, each government
agrees that compliance with this audit annex will be evaluated at least once
every three years by its own appropriate review and oversight organization.
A copy of the results of such reviews shall be provided to the other government.</al>
                     <al>Solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts shall contain suitable provisions
to enable the participating governments to act for and on behalf of one another
under this annex and shall authorize access to contractor facilities and records
as necessary. Nothing in this annex is to be construed to limit a purchasing
government's rights or remedies, including access to contractors records,
as may be authorized by contract or the laws of the purchasing government.</al></li><li><li.nr>III.</li.nr><al>Scope of Audit Annex</al><al>This annex encompasses audits in support of contracts and subcontracts
for defense equipment and services contemplated or executed under the MOU
and FMS letters of offer and acceptance. It does not cover audits for architecture
and engineering, construction, base support, operation and maintenance, or
banking services, nor does it cover audits of universities, and contractors
solely in the business of supporting the U.S. presence in the Netherlands.
For purposes of this annex, defense contract audit services shall include
the following types of audits:</al>
                     <al>
                        <nadruk type="cur">Forward Pricing Audits: </nadruk>Review of proposals submitted in contemplation
of a contract award or a contract modification, to determine the allowability,
allocability, and reasonableness of each proposed cost element.</al>
                     <al>
                        <nadruk type="cur">Accounting System Audits: </nadruk>Review of contractor accounting records,
procedures, and systems to determine their accuracy, currency, completeness,
and compliance with contract requirements.</al>
                     <al>
                        <nadruk type="cur">Estimating System Audit: </nadruk>Evaluation of cost estimating systems.</al>
                     <al>
                        <nadruk type="cur">Post Award Audits: </nadruk>Verify after contract award the currency,
accuracy, and completeness of cost or pricing data submitted to the purchasing
government as of the completion of negotiations. Post award audits shall be
automatically performed; that is, without a request, by both governments whenever
a contract or contract modification has been awarded that exceeds the then
current U.S. threshold for mandatory post award audits (the current threshold
is $ 50,000,000) and the purchasing government relied upon certified cost
or pricing data submitted by a contractor. For contract awards less than this
threshold, in which the purchasing government relied upon certified cost or
pricing data submitted by a contractor, post award audits will be performed
based upon a sampling approach devised by the performing government or whenever
there are indications that a post award audit is appropriate based on prior
experience with a contractor. In addition, other post award audits will be
performed upon request of the purchasing government.</al>
                     <al>
                        <nadruk type="cur">Reimbursement Vouchers Audits: </nadruk>Verify payment vouchers submitted
under cost reimbursement contracts or other contracts with cost reimbursement
features (e.g. material reimbursement) and recommend cost disallowances when
appropriate.</al>
                     <al>
                        <nadruk type="cur">Audits of Disclosed Accounting Practices:  </nadruk>Verify contractor
compliance with disclosed accounting practices and contractual accounting
requirements.</al>
                     <al>

                     <al>Requests for audits shall specify the type of audit services needed, the
contractor, the contractor's address, the subcontractor and address (if applicable),
the proposal (if one is to be audited), any items requiring special review,
the calendar date (not the number days after receipt of audit request) that
the audit is needed by, a point of contact, telephone number, and facsimile
telephone number. Acceptance of requests shall be acknowledged by telephonic
facsimile by the performing government and a point of contact, telephone number,
and facsimile number shall be provided.</al>
                     <al>Each government agrees to establish a liaison person for this audit annex.
The liaison office, liaison person, and telephone number shall be identified
in each audit report. The liaison person shall assist in obtaining clarifications
of audit requests or audit reports whenever necessary. The liaison person
shall also assist in resolving problems with the timeliness, content, or quality
of audit reports. If unable to resolve such problems, the issue will be escalated
to successive managers (up to, in the Netherlands, the Director, Material
Acquisition, Ministry of Defense, or, in the U.S., the Director, Foreign Contracting,
Office of the Secretary of Defense).</al><al>Each government agrees to provide audit reports in a timely manner. Audit
reports submitted in accordance with the requested due dates, which for forward
pricing audits is generally 45 days after receipt of request for audit, are
timely. If the due date specified by the requesting government cannot be met,
the performing government shall contact the point of contact identified in
the audit request to explain the reasons for the delay. If the failure to
meet the requested due date is caused by external factors, not within the
control of the government performing the audit (such as not obtaining necessary
cost data from a contractor), the purchasing government shall attempt to assist
in resolving the problem and grant reasonable extensions as appropriate. If
the inability to meet the requested due date is caused by action or inaction
of the performing government, the issue will be escalated to the attention
of the audit annex liaison person and to successive managers.</al>
                     <al>The participating governments shall provide each other with access to
all available information concerning contractor cost estimating systems and
disclosed accounting practices when needed to support contract negotiations
or enforcement. It is expected that contracts requiring the disclosure of
accounting practices shall normally authorize contractors to file such disclosures
with their own governments. In the United States, the files shall be maintained
by the office administering the contract. In the Netherlands, the files shall
be maintained by the Director of the Audit Agency.</al><al>In order that the equity of this annex may be periodically appraised,
information copies of all requests for audit by both countries will be sent
to Defense Contract Audit Agency, European Branch office, Lindsey Air Station,
APO New York 09633. To facilitate these periodic reviews, both governments
agree to maintain a list of all audits performed for each other and the specific
office that requested the audit shall be identified in such list.</al></li><li><li.nr>VI.</li.nr><al>Content of Audit Reports</al>
                     <al>All audit reports shall describe the type, scope, depth of the evaluation
performed, and a point of contact with a telephone number. The audit reports
shall describe what was reviewed or evaluated, the methodology used to perform
the review, findings of the review, recommendations of the auditor, and the
basis for the recommendations. The audit report shall address any areas that
were specifically requested for review. Each audit report shall state that
the proposal was audited for unallowable costs and identify any unallowable
costs. While audits requested pursuant to this agreement will not encompass
investigations, audits shall be performed in a manner that will provide reasonable
assurance of detecting errors, irregularities, abuse, or illegal acts that:
(1) could have a direct (or indirect) and material effect on contractor financial
representations or the results of financial related audits; or (2) significantly
affect the audit objectives. The audit report should identify the extent to
which issues raised by the auditor were discussed with the contractor. Supporting
evaluations by technical and other specialists shall be included in the reports
as appropriate. The purchasing government may request additional clarifications
or supporting data if necessary, and shall have the final authority to determine
when the information provided is adequate for its purposes.</al><al>For forward pricing audits, the reports shall, for each element of proposed
cost, identify the offeror's proposed cost, the basis for the proposed cost,
how the auditor evaluated it, any recommended exceptions (questioned costs),
and rationale supporting the recommended exceptions (questioned costs). The
information supplied in the audit report should be sufficiently detailed to
permit the purchasing government to develop and justify negotiation position.</al></li><li><li.nr>VII.</li.nr><al>Protection of Information</al><al>Information obtained through the implementation of this annex shall receive
the same protection against unauthorized disclosure as it would normally receive
under the laws and rules of the participating government which possesses it.</al></li><li><li.nr>VIII.</li.nr><al>Charges</al><al>Services will be provided under this annex without charge for all defense
contracts, subcontracts, and FMS Letters of Offer and Acceptance entered into
on or after the date of implementation of this annex provided that a joint
review of the services being exchanged between the participating governments
performed at not less than three year intervals indicates that general reciprocity
is being maintained. If after such joint review either government determines
that charges will be necessary, they may be imposed after not less than one
year advance notice. Should charges by the U.S. Government become necessary,
FMS procedures then in effect will apply.</al>

                     <lijst><li><li.nr>I.</li.nr><al> Introduction</al><al>This Annex sets forth the terms, conditions and procedures which shall
govern a scientist and engineer exchange program (&#x201C;the Exchange Program&#x201D;)
between The Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom of The Netherlands (&#x201C;NL MOD&#x201D;)
and the Department of Defense of the United States (&#x201C;US DOD&#x201D;), hereafter
referred to as &#x201C;The Parties&#x201D;. Professional knowledge of both Parties shall
be shared for maximum mutual benefits to the extent authorized by the policies,
laws and regulations of the United States and The Netherlands.</al></li><li><li.nr>II.</li.nr><al> General Principles</al>
                     <al>In order to implement the Exchange Program, the Parties agree to provide
on-site working assignments to selected scientists and engineers from the
other Party (hereafter referred to as &#x201C;the Exchange Personnel&#x201D;) in US DOD
and NL MOD research, development and logistics facilities. The work assignments
shall provide Exchange Personnel with knowledge of the organization and management
of Host Party research and development activities related to conventional
military systems. This Exchange Program shall not include technical training
nor is it to be used as a mechanism for obtaining technical data related to
the design, development and manufacture of military systems. Exchange of scientists
and engineers under this Annex shall be conducted on a reciprocal basis so
that value to each Party shall be essentially equal.</al><al>The Exchange Program shall be administered by Executive Agents. The Executive
Agent for the US DOD is the Department of the Army; for the NL MOD, the Executive
Agent is the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).
The program shall be administered in compliance with Appendix A.</al>
                     </li><li><li.nr>III.</li.nr><al> Selection and Assignment of Candidates</al>
                     <al>Participation in the Exchange Program is restricted to military officers
and civilian employees of the US DOD and the NL MOD and to employees of the
Netherlands Organization For Applied Scientific Research TNO and National
Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) and the Maritime Research Institute of the Netherlands
(MARIN) working on behalf of the MOD.</al><al>The placement of each candidate nominated under this program is conditional
upon the ability of the Host Party to provide work assignments commensurate
with the purpose and scope of the program for a mutually agreed period.</al>
                     <al>Candidates should hold at least a baccalaureate degree in a scientific
field and should have at least two years practical experience in the technical
area related to the position to which they are assigned. Some exchanges, however,
may require higher academic qualifications.</al>
                     <al>To assist in the evaluation and selection of candidates, the NL MOD and
the US DOD shall provide background resumes, areas of interest, and assignment
objectives for each candidate, following the format of Attachment 1 of Appendix
A, at least 12 months prior to the desired date of assignment. It shall be
the responsibility of the Host Party Executive Agent to provide, within 6
months of the desired date of assignment, a position description for available
positions. The position description shall follow the outline at Attachment
2 of Appendix A. Final selection of candidates, and their assignment to a
position nominated by the Host Party, shall be by mutual agreement between
the NL MOD and the US DOD.</al>
                     <al>Exchange Personnel shall not act in a liaison capacity or otherwise act
as representatives of their respective Party or government while assigned
to an exchange position, nor shall they act as representatives of the Host
