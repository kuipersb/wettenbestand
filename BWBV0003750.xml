			 <al>Preamble</al> 
			 <al>Parties to this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as
				&#x201C;Parties&#x201D;),</al> 
			 <al>Considering that Ministers agreed in the Tokyo Declaration of 14
				September 1973 that comprehensive Multilateral Trade Negotiations in the
				framework of the <extref status="actief" doc="1.0:v:BWBV0001160&amp;verdragtekst=" compleet="nee">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</extref> (hereinafter referred
				to as &#x201C;General Agreement&#x201D; or &#x201C;GATT&#x201D;) should aim, inter alia, to reduce or
				eliminate non-tariff measures or, where this is not appropriate, their trade
				restricting or distorting effects, and to bring such measures under more
				effective international discipline;</al> 
			 <al>Considering that Ministers also agreed that negotiations should
				aim to secure additional benefits for the international trade of developing
				countries, and recognized the importance of the application of differential
				measures in ways which will provide special and more favourable treatment for
				them where this is feasible and appropriate;</al> 
			 <al>Recognizing that in order to achieve their economic and social
				objectives to implement programmes and policies of economic development aimed
				at raising the standard of living of their people, taking into account their
				balance-of-payments position, developing countries may need to adopt agreed
				differential measures;</al> 
			 <al>Considering that Ministers in the Tokyo Declaration recognized
				that the particular situation and problems of the least developed among the
				developing countries shall be given special attention and stressed the need to
				ensure that these countries receive special treatment in the context of any
				general or specific measures taken in favour of the developing countries during
				the negotiations;</al> 
			 <al>Recognizing the need to establish an agreed international
				framework of rights and obligations with respect to laws, regulations,
				procedures and practices regarding government procurement with a view to
				achieving greater liberalization and expansion of world trade and improving the
				international framework for the conduct of world trade;</al> 
			 <al>Recognizing that laws, regulations, procedures and practices
				regarding government procurement should not be prepared, adopted or applied to
				foreign or domestic products and to foreign or domestic suppliers so as to
				afford protection to domestic products or suppliers and should not discriminate
				among foreign products or suppliers;</al> 
			 <al>Recognizing that it is desirable to provide transparency of laws,
				regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement;</al> 
			 <al>Recognizing the need to establish international procedures on
				notification, consultation, surveillance and dispute settlement with a view to
				ensuring a fair, prompt and effective enforcement of the international
				provisions on government procurement and to maintain the balance of rights and
				obligations at the highest possible level;</al>
